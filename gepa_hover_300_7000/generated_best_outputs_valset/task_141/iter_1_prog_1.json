    "full_assistant_response": "### reasoning:  \nThe claim links Tahoe Tessie to an underwater tunnel (Cave Rock Tunnel) and references a town seven miles south of it (Stateline) with a 2010 population of 842. The documents confirm the Cave Rock Tunnel\u2019s location near Lake Tahoe and its association with Tahoe Tessie. The third document explicitly states the tunnel is seven miles north of Stateline, aligning with the claim\u2019s geographic relationship. The query must include terms like \"Tahoe Tessie,\" \"underwater tunnel,\" \"Cave Rock Tunnel,\" \"seven miles south,\" and \"Stateline\" to target these connections. The population figure (842) is part of the claim but not explicitly in the documents, so it is included as a contextual filter.  \n\n### query:  \n\"Tahoe Tessie underwater tunnel\" AND \"Cave Rock Tunnel\" AND \"seven miles south Stateline\" AND \"2010 census population 842\""
