    "full_assistant_response": "### reasoning:  \nThe claim asserts that **Avery Waddell** is the **director of NBC Studios** and directed **Road Trip** (starring **Breckin Meyer**) and **another film** with **Breckin Meyer**. However, the documents do not mention **Avery Waddell** in any capacity. Instead, **Road Trip** is explicitly directed by **Todd Phillips**, and **Breckin Meyer** appears in multiple films (e.g., *Blast*, *Blue State*, *Tail Lights Fade*), but none of these are attributed to **Avery Waddell**. The only document mentioning **NBC Studios** is *Inside Schwartz*, which credits **20th Century Fox Television** and **NBC Studios** as producers, but no director is named. To address gaps:  \n1. **Avery Waddell** is absent from all documents, so the claim\u2019s entity is unverified.  \n2. **Road Trip** is directed by **Todd Phillips**, conflicting with the claim\u2019s attribution to **Avery Waddell**.  \n3. **Other films with Breckin Meyer** (e.g., *Blast*, *Blue State*) are directed by different individuals (e.g., **Anthony Hickox**, **Mark Waters**).  \n4. **NBC Studios** is a producer, not a director, and no director is explicitly linked to it in the documents.  \n\nTo resolve ambiguities:  \n- Use **explicit entity checks** for **Avery Waddell** and **NBC Studios**.  \n- Exclude **Todd Phillips** (director of *Road Trip*) via \"NOT\" to avoid false matches.  \n- Include **Breckin Meyer** and **other films** to confirm his involvement, but ensure the director is not **Avery Waddell**.  \n\n### query:  \n\"Avery Waddell\" AND (\"NBC Studios\" OR \"NBC\") AND (\"Road Trip\" OR \"Road Trip (film)\") AND \"Breckin Meyer\" AND NOT \"Todd Phillips\" AND (\"Blast\" OR \"Blue State\" OR \"Tail Lights Fade\") AND NOT (\"Anthony Hickox\" OR \"Mark Waters\" OR \"Malcolm Ingram\")"
