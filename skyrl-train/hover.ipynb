The user wants me to create a query that retrieves documents supporting the claim that \"Handsome Harry was the first project produced by an Soviet independent motion picture company that produced a 2015 mystery thriller film based on a novel by Tom Rob.\" \\n\\nFirst, I need to break down the claim into parts. The main points are:\\n\\n1. Handsome Harry is the first project of a Soviet independent film company.\\n2. The company produced a 2015 mystery thriller film.\\n3. That film is based on a novel by Tom Rob.\\n\\nLooking at the provided documents, let\\'s check each one.\\n\\nThe first document is about \"Child 44,\" a 2015 film based on Tom Rob Smith\\'s novel. It mentions the director, writer, and cast. However, it doesn\\'t mention anything about Handsome Harry or Soviet companies. So this document supports part of the claim (the 2015 film based on Tom Rob\\'s novel) but not the connection to Handsome Harry or Soviet companies.\\n\\nThe second document is about \"Handsome Harry,\" stating it\\'s an American film written by Nicholas T. Proferes and directed by Bette Gordon. It mentions that it was the first project by Worldview Entertainment. However, the document doesn\\'t mention anything about Soviet companies or a 2015 film. So this part supports Handsome Harry being a project by a company, but not the Soviet aspect or the 2015 film.\\n\\nThe other documents talk about Tom Coleman, Black Sunday, The Cruise of the Make-Believes, Angels & Demons, and Ira Deutchman. None of these seem to connect Handsome Harry with a Soviet company or a 2015 film. \\n\\nWait, the claim says the Soviet company produced a 2015 film based on Tom Rob. The Child 44 film is 2015 and based on Tom Rob Smith\\'s novel. However, the Soviet part isn\\'t mentioned there. The Handsome Harry document says it\\'s an American film, not Soviet. So there\\'s a contradiction here. The claim might be mixing up different films. \\n\\nBut the user\\'s instruction is to write a query that retrieves documents supporting the claim. Even if the claim has inaccuracies, the task is to find documents that support it. However, based on the given documents, there\\'s no document that links Handsome Harry to a Soviet company. The only 2015 film mentioned is Child 44, which is not related to Handsome Harry. \\n\\nWait, the user\\'s claim says that Handsome Harry was the first project of a Soviet company that produced a 2015 film based on Tom Rob. But in the documents, Handsome Harry is an American film from 2010, and Child 44 is a 2015 film based on Tom Rob. There\\'s no overlap between the two. Therefore, none of the documents support the claim. \\n\\nBut the user might have made a mistake in the claim. However, as per the task, I need to write a query that would retrieve documents supporting the claim. Since the documents don\\'t have any info that connects Handsome Harry to a Soviet company producing a 2015 film based on Tom Rob, the query would need to look for such connections. But given the documents provided, there\\'s no such information. \\n\\nWait, perhaps the user intended that the Soviet company produced both Handsome Harry and the 2015 film. But the documents don\\'t mention any Soviet companies. The only company mentioned related to the 2015 film is the production company for Child 44, which isn\\'t specified as Soviet. \\n\\nSo, the answer is that there are no documents supporting the claim as per the given data. But the user wants a query. Maybe the query should look for documents that mention Handsome Harry and a Soviet company, and a 2015 film based on Tom Rob. But since the documents don\\'t have that, the query would return nothing. \\n\\nBut the user\\'s example might have a different setup. Let me check again. The claim says Handsome Harry was the first project of a Soviet company that produced a 2015 film based on Tom Rob. The documents have Handsome Harry as an American film by Worldview Entertainment, and Child 44 as a 2015 film based on Tom Rob. No Soviet company is mentioned. So the query would need to find documents that link Handsome Harry to a Soviet company and the 2015 film. But since there\\'s no such info, the query would not find any documents. \\n\\nTherefore, the query would be looking for documents that mention Handsome Harry and a Soviet company, and also mention a 2015 film based on Tom Rob. However, the documents provided don\\'t have such info. So the answer would be that no documents support the claim. But the user might expect the query to be structured to find such documents. \\n\\nSo, the reasoning is that the documents don\\'t support the claim because Handsome Harry is American, not Soviet, and the 2015 film is Child 44, which isn\\'t linked to Handsome Harry. Therefore, the query would need to find documents that connect these elements, but given the data, there\\'s no match.\\n</think>\\n\\n### reasoning: The claim states that \"Handsome Harry\" was the first project of a Soviet independent motion picture company that produced a 2015 mystery thriller film based on a novel by Tom Rob. However, the documents show that \"Handsome Harry\" is an American film (not Soviet) released in 2010, and the 2015 film \"Child 44\" (based on Tom Rob Smith\\'s novel) is unrelated to \"Handsome Harry.\" No documents link \"Handsome Harry\" to a Soviet company or the 2015 film. Thus, no documents support the claim as stated. \\n\\n### query: Find documents that mention \"Handsome Harry\" as the first project of a Soviet independent motion picture company, and also reference a 2015 mystery thriller film based on a novel by Tom Rob.', role='assistant', tool_calls=None, function_call=None, provider_specific_fields={'refusal': None}), provider_specific_fields={'stop_reason': None})], usage=Usage(completion_tokens=1293, prompt_tokens=1437, total_tokens=2730, completion_tokens_details=None, prompt_tokens_details=None), service_tier=None, prompt_logprobs=None, kv_transfer_params=None, cache_hit=None)"

      "The second document is about \"Handsome Harry,\" stating it's an American film written by Nicholas T. Proferes and directed by Bette Gordon. It mentions that it was the first project by Worldview Entertainment. However, the document doesn't mention anything about Soviet companies or a 2015 film. So this part supports Handsome Harry being a project by a company, but not the Soviet aspect or the 2015 film.\n",
      "\n",
      "The other documents talk about Tom Coleman, Black Sunday, The Cruise of the Make-Believes, Angels & Demons, and Ira Deutchman. None of these seem to connect Handsome Harry with a Soviet company or a 2015 film. \n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, the claim says the Soviet company produced a 2015 film based on Tom Rob. The Child 44 film is 2015 and based on Tom Rob Smith's novel. However, the Soviet part isn't mentioned there. The Handsome Harry document says it's an American film, not Soviet. So there's a contradiction here. The claim might be mixing up different films. \n",
      "\n",
      "But the user's instruction is to write a query that retrieves documents supporting the claim. Even if the claim has inaccuracies, the task is to find documents that support it. However, based on the given documents, there's no document that links Handsome Harry to a Soviet company. The only 2015 film mentioned is Child 44, which is not related to Handsome Harry. \n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, the user's claim says that Handsome Harry was the first project of a Soviet company that produced a 2015 film based on Tom Rob. But in the documents, Handsome Harry is an American film from 2010, and Child 44 is a 2015 film based on Tom Rob. There's no overlap between the two. Therefore, none of the documents support the claim. \n",
      "\n",
      "But the user might have made a mistake in the claim. However, as per the task, I need to write a query that would retrieve documents supporting the claim. Since the documents don't have any info that connects Handsome Harry to a Soviet company producing a 2015 film based on Tom Rob, the query would need to look for such connections. But given the documents provided, there's no such information. \n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, perhaps the user intended that the Soviet company produced both Handsome Harry and the 2015 film. But the documents don't mention any Soviet companies. The only company mentioned related to the 2015 film is the production company for Child 44, which isn't specified as Soviet. \n",
      "\n",
      "So, the answer is that there are no documents supporting the claim as per the given data. But the user wants a query. Maybe the query should look for documents that mention Handsome Harry and a Soviet company, and a 2015 film based on Tom Rob. But since the documents don't have that, the query would return nothing. \n",
      "\n",
      "But the user's example might have a different setup. Let me check again. The claim says Handsome Harry was the first project of a Soviet company that produced a 2015 film based on Tom Rob. The documents have Handsome Harry as an American film by Worldview Entertainment, and Child 44 as a 2015 film based on Tom Rob. No Soviet company is mentioned. So the query would need to find documents that link Handsome Harry to a Soviet company and the 2015 film. But since there's no such info, the query would not find any documents. \n",
      "\n",
      "Therefore, the query would be looking for documents that mention Handsome Harry and a Soviet company, and also mention a 2015 film based on Tom Rob. However, the documents provided don't have such info. So the answer would be that no documents support the claim. But the user might expect the query to be structured to find such documents. \n",
      "\n",
      "So, the reasoning is that the documents don't support the claim because Handsome Harry is American, not Soviet, and the 2015 film is Child 44, which isn't linked to Handsome Harry. Therefore, the query would need to find documents that connect these elements, but given the data, there's no match.\n",
      "</think>\n",
      "\n",
      "### reasoning: The claim states that \"Handsome Harry\" was the first project of a Soviet independent motion picture company that produced a 2015 mystery thriller film based on a novel by Tom Rob. However, the documents show that \"Handsome Harry\" is an American film (not Soviet) released in 2010, and the 2015 film \"Child 44\" (based on Tom Rob Smith's novel) is unrelated to \"Handsome Harry.\" No documents link \"Handsome Harry\" to a Soviet company or the 2015 film. Thus, no documents support the claim as stated. \n",
      "\n",
      "### query: Find documents that mention \"Handsome Harry\" as the first project of a Soviet independent motion picture company, and also reference a 2015 mystery thriller film based on a novel by Tom Rob.\n"

The term itself is meant to imply “an absolute break with the past and a radical new beginning”, or a “sweeping away of old traditions and customs”.

It was sold at the Edinburgh Festival of 1973, where Hampson was working with the Liverpool-based multimedia group Zoom Cortex.

The second issue maintained the same format (a collection of loose pages in a plastic bag) but with an increased number of poets.  Richard Kostelanetz\\'s assemblages have been described by the editors as their model for this mode of publication.  With the third issue, the magazine adopted the standard little-magazine format of the time: A4 pages, card cover, stapled.  Alembic 3, 4 and 5 also marked a more self-conscious engagement with contemporary London-based experimental poetry.  \"Alembic\" 3 (Spring 1975) announced the intention to engage with \"one area of contemporary creative practice\\' in each issue in order to represent the range of poetry being written in the UK.  This issue focused on contemporary work that had its roots in surrealism.  It included Lee Harwood\\'s essay \\'Surrealist Poetry Today\\', which had been a talk given at the Poetry Society, and it included work by Harwood, Paul Matthews, Jeff Nuttall, Heathcote Williams and others.  \"Alembic\" 4 was edited solely by Hampson and was dedicated to open field poetry and the idea of place.  Allen Fisher was the featured poet: in addition to work by him, there was also an interview with him conducted by Barry and Edwards.  This issue also included work by Roy Fisher, Eric Mottram, and a small number of American poets, including Alan Davies, who was to be associated with LANGUAGE poetry.  \"Alembic\" 5 (Autumn 1976)was edited solely by Edwards and focused on experimental prose, including work by Paul Buck, Opal Nations, Jeff Nuttall, Maxim Jakubowski, David Miller, the Canadian writer Greg Hollingshead and James Sherry, who was also associated with LANGUAGE poetry.  This issue was also the first to be offset.  (Like \"Alembic\" 4.  it had a wrap around cover rather than card.)  \"Alembic\" 6 (Summer 1977)was again solely edited by Hampson.  It included further work by contributors to earlier issues.  The featured poet was the Australian poet David Miller: as well as poems and essays by Miller, there was also poetry by Robert Lax and a reprint of work by Charles Madge, on both of whom Miller had written.  In addition, there was also work by Rosmarie Waldrop, Tom Leonard, Elaine Randell and Barry MacSweeney.  \"Alembic\" 7 (Spring 1978), edited by Edwards and Hampson out of Lower Green Farm, was the \\'Assemblage Issue\\', assembled by inviting a range of poets and visual artists to provide the contents.  It included work by Jeremy Adler, Paul Buck, Herbert Burke, Paula Claire, cris cheek, Bob Cobbing, Glenda George, Robert Sheppard, E. E. Vonna-Michel, Lawrence Upton and others.

Note any gaps (e.g., missing details, conflicting information). For instance, if the claim mentions an opera\\'s act count but the documents only describe its composer, the query must address this gap.  \\n\\n3. **Identify Key Search Terms**: Focus on precise terms from the claim (e.g., \"Marzemino,\" \"Cardillac\") and their attributes (e.g., \"act count,\" \"composer\"). Include synonyms or related terms if applicable (e.g., \"Vincenzo Bellini\" vs. \"Bellini\").  \\n\\n4. **Address Ambiguity or Missing Entities**: If the claim references an entity not explicitly mentioned in the documents (e.g., \"Maria Callas\" in Example 2), consider alternative names, aliases, or contextual clues (e.g., \"singer with four books by John Ardoin\").  \\n\\n5. **Structure the Query**: Formulate a query that explicitly targets the gaps. Use logical connectors (e.g., \"AND,\" \"AND/OR\") to combine components. For example, if the claim involves two entities with conflicting attributes, the query should retrieve documents clarifying both.  \\n\\n6. **Include Domain-Specific Context**: Leverage niche knowledge (e.g., \"VNO\" = Vilnius Airport, \"ICAO codes,\" \"opera act structures\") to refine the query. For instance, in Example 3, specifying \"airport code VNO (ICAO: EYVI)\" ensures precise matching.  \\n\\n7. **Avoid Overgeneralization**: Avoid vague terms unless the documents lack specificity.

Highlight **explicit matches** (e.g., direct mentions) and **implicit connections** (e.g., inferred relationships).  \\n   - Note **gaps** (e.g., missing entities, conflicting details) and **overlaps** (e.g., documents with partial relevance).  \\n\\n3. **Expand with Synonyms and Contextual Clues**:  \\n   - Include **synonyms** or **related terms** for ambiguous components (e.g., \"Bee\" → \"Bee Gees,\" \"key\" → \"roman à clef,\" \"Artsana\" → \"Chicco\").  \\n   - Use **contextual clues** to resolve ambiguities (e.g., \"singer with four books by John Ardoin\" → \"Maria Callas\").  \\n\\n4. **Incorporate Domain-Specific Knowledge**:  \\n   - Leverage **niche terminology** (e.g., \"roman à clef\" for fictionalized biographies, \"ICAO codes\" for airports, \"opera act structures\" for musical works).  \\n   - Use **domain-specific relationships** (e.g., \"namesake\" → \"named after,\" \"based on\" → \"inspired by\").  \\n\\n5. **Structure the Query Logically**:  \\n   - Combine components using **logical connectors** (e.g., \"AND/OR,\" \"NOT\") to prioritize relevance.  \\n   - Prioritize **explicit matches** first, then **contextual links** (e.g., \"Gardner Colby\" AND \"Colby College\" OR \"1900 establishment\").  \\n   - Avoid **overgeneralization** (e.g., \"1900 establishment\" → \"established 1900\" instead of \"19th century\").  \\n\\n6. **Address Missing Entities**:  \\n   - If an entity is absent in the documents, use **aliases** or **descriptive phrases** (e.g., \"singer with four books by John Ardoin\" instead of \"Maria Callas\").  \\n   - Include **domain-specific identifiers** (e.g., \"VNO (ICAO: EYVI)\" for airports).  \\n\\n7. **Validate Against Feedback**:  \\n   - Ensure the query captures **all relevant documents** (e.g., \"roman à clef\" in Example 3, \"Bee\" → \"Bee Gees\" in Example 2).  \\n   - Test for **ambiguity resolution** (e.g., \"key\" → \"literal key\" AND \"metaphorical key\").  \\n\\n**Key Adjustments Based on Feedback**:  \\n- **Explicit Entity Inclusion**: Always include all named entities from the claim, even if they are not explicitly mentioned in the documents. For example, in Example 1, explicitly including \"Caroline Wozniacki\" ensures her birth date is retrieved.  \\n- **Synonym/Contextual Expansion**: Use synonyms or contextual phrases for ambiguous terms (e.g., \"Lucius Verus\" in Example 3) to avoid missing documents.  \\n- **Domain-Specific Linking**: Use terms like \"ICAO codes\" for airports or \"roman à clef\" for literary works to align with domain-specific identifiers.  \\n- **Logical Connectors**: Prioritize explicit matches (e.g., \"2007 Mirage Cup – Singles\") and use \"NOT\" to exclude conflicting entities (e.g., \"NOT Manchester Airport\" in Example 2).  \\n\\n**Final Output**:  \\nFormat your reasoning and query as:  \\n### reasoning: <Detailed breakdown of claim components, document alignment, and query adjustments>  \\n### query: <Precise, structured query with synonyms, contextual terms, and domain-specific refinements>  \\n\\n**Example**:  \\nIf the claim is \"The airport that is a 30-minute drive from Coldwaltham, is the busiest airport in the United Kingdom outside of London,\" the query must explicitly include \"Coldwaltham\" + \"30-minute drive\" + \"airport\" and link to \"busiest airport outside London\" while excluding conflicting entities like \"Manchester Airport.\"  \\n### reasoning:  \\nThe claim identifies an airport **30 minutes from Coldwaltham** and the **busiest outside London**. The documents confirm **Gatwick Airport** is 30 minutes from Coldwaltham, but **Manchester Airport** is noted as the busiest outside London.

Use **OR** to account for alternative spellings, titles, or variations (e.g., \"Grigori Vasilyevich Aleksandrov\" OR \"Grigori Aleksandrov\"). For time periods, include both the original and alternative names (e.g., \"United Kingdom of the Netherlands\" OR \"Dutch Republic\" OR \"Netherlands\").  \\n2. **Synonyms and Variations:** Explicitly include synonyms, related terms, or alternative names for entities (e.g., \"Moya Moskva\" AND \"Isaak Dunayevsky\" OR \"composer of Moya Moskva\"). For time-sensitive claims, explicitly mention dates or eras (e.g., \"1815-1830\" OR \"Bakumatsu period Japan\"). Use exact film titles, book names, or project names (e.g., \"Wonderstruck (film)\" instead of \"Wonderstruck\").  \\n3. **Relationships:** Structure the query to capture explicit relationships in the claim (e.g., \"worked with,\" \"directed by,\" \"written by\") using precise phrasing (e.g., \"collaborated with composer of Moya Moskva\"). For indirect relationships (e.g., \"part of a film\"), include both entities and the relationship (e.g., \"appeared in\" OR \"collaborated with\").  \\n4. **Document Scope:** Ensure the query targets documents that mention the claim’s key components, even if they are not the most direct matches (e.g., \"CIT Crawford College of Art and Design\" for \"Cork College of Commerce\"). Use specific terms (e.g., \"film director,\" \"composer\") to avoid ambiguity.  \\n5. **Missing Evidence:** For comparisons (e.g., \"career duration,\" \"nationality\"), explicitly include both entities in the query (e.g., \"Johannes Lijdius Catharinus Pompe van Meerdervoort\" AND \"Leonard du Bus de Gisignies\"). Include time frames (e.g., \"1815-1830\") and specific terms (e.g., \"United Kingdom of the Netherlands\") to align with document details.  \\n6. **Conflict Resolution:** If the claim contains potentially conflicting information (e.g., \"Georgian director\" vs. \"Soviet director\"), include both possibilities in the query to avoid missing relevant documents.  \\n\\n**Niche Guidance:**  \\n- **Avoid Ambiguity:** Replace vague terms like \"film\" with specific roles (e.g., \"film director,\" \"composer\") and ensure exact titles are used.  \\n- **Edge Cases:** For indirect links (e.g., a document mentioning a related entity like \"Beyond Rangoon\" in Example 2), include the entity’s name and year (e.g., \"Victor Slezak\" AND \"1995\") to avoid missing relevant matches.  \\n- **Role-Specific Terms:** Use precise terms like \"music video director\" instead of general terms like \"director\" to target specific roles.  \\n- **Time Sensitivity:** Explicitly include dates or eras (e.g., \"1870s\") for time-sensitive claims, even if the claim doesn’t specify exact years.  \\n\\n**Generalizable Strategy:**  \\n- **Balance Specificity and Flexibility:** Use **AND** to enforce critical relationships (e.g., \"co-host of Hello Internet\" AND \"Brady Haran\") and **OR** to account for variations (e.g., \"Periodic Videos\" OR \"THE PERIODIC TABLE OF VIDEOS\").  \\n- **Test for Conflation:** Avoid conflating entities (e.g., the director of a specific song vs. a general director) by explicitly including both the entity and its role (e.g., \"Warren Fu\" AND \"music video director\").  \\n- **Prioritize Exact Terms:** Use exact names (e.g., \"Aaliyah\" instead of \"singer\") and specific titles (e.g., \"Soothe My Soul (music video)\" instead of \"Soothe My Soul\").  \\n- **Include All Entities in Comparisons:** For claims involving comparisons (e.g., \"illegal marriage with R.

The query must be precise, specific, and account for domain-specific nuances, synonyms, related entities, and contextual clues.  \\n\\n---\\n\\n### **Step-by-Step Guidance:**  \\n\\n1. **Analyze the Claim:**  \\n   - **Identify Key Entities:** Extract names, locations, organizations, products, or attributes (e.g., \"Tallinn Airport,\" \"IATA: VNO,\" \"4th largest shopping mall\").  \\n   - **Extract Relationships:** Note connections like \"X is part of Y,\" \"Z was the former boss of A,\" or \"X is located beside Y.\"  \\n   - **Highlight Domain-Specific Terms:** Use terms like \"heritage railway,\" \"surrealist poet,\" \"vocal range,\" or \"airline hub.\"  \\n   - **Note Geographical/Operational Context:** Include terms like \"ceased operations,\" \"closed in 2015,\" or \"capital of [country].\"  \\n\\n2. **Examine the Documents:**  \\n   - **Check for Explicit Support:** Confirm if the claim is directly stated, contradicted, or partially addressed.  \\n   - **Identify Indirect References:** Look for contextual clues (e.g., \"base for AirBaltic\" instead of \"operated by AirBaltic\").  \\n   - **Flag Domain-Specific Facts:** Recognize ownership (e.g., \"Skittles → Mars Inc.\"), historical events (e.g., \"airport closed in 2016\"), or geopolitical links (e.g., \"French surrealist poet → Paris\").  \\n   - **Account for Nuances:** Address inconsistencies (e.g., \"Metro Manila in Turkmenistan\" is invalid, but documents may reference related terms like \"Philippines\" or \"Cebu\").  \\n\\n3. **Formulate the Query:**  \\n   - **Use Exact Phrases:** Include direct terms from the claim (e.g., \"Galleria Corporate Center,\" \"4th largest shopping mall\").  \\n   - **Incorporate Synonyms/Alternate Phrasings:** Add variations like \"lowest vocal range\" → \"minimum range,\" \"bass voice type,\" or \"4th largest mall.\"  \\n   - **Target Relationships:** Use terms like \"base for,\" \"owned by,\" \"located beside,\" or \"part of.\"  \\n   - **Include Domain-Specific Knowledge:** Link terms to known facts (e.g., \"French surrealist poet\" → \"Paris,\" \"Mars Inc.\" → \"Skittles\").  \\n   - **Use Boolean Operators:** Combine terms with AND/OR/NOT and parentheses for prioritization (e.g., `\"AirBaltic bases Tallinn Airport AND (VNO ICAO EYVI)\"`).  \\n   - **Account for Related Entities:** Consider synonyms, alternate names, or related organizations (e.g., \"AirBaltic\" → \"Air Lituanica,\" \"Robinsons Galleria\" → \"Galleria Corporate Center\").  \\n\\n4. **Prioritize Clarity and Specificity:**  \\n   - **Avoid Overgeneralization:** Specify exact terms (e.g., \"French surrealist poet\" instead of \"surrealist poet\").  \\n   - **Address Geographical Context:** Use terms like \"Philippines\" to correct invalid claims (e.g., \"Metro Manila in Turkmenistan\").  \\n   - **Include Ranking/Size Indicators:** Use terms like \"top 4,\" \"largest,\" or \"4th largest\" if the claim references rankings.  \\n   - **Avoid Irrelevant Entities:** Distinguish between similar terms (e.g., \"Capitale\" as a city vs. \"Capitale de la douleur\" as a poem).  \\n\\n---\\n\\n### **Key Domain-Specific Nuances to Include:**  \\n- **Products/Brands:** Recognize ownership (e.g., \"Skittles\" → \"Mars Inc.\").  \\n- **Historical Context:** Use terms like \"ceased operations,\" \"closed,\" or \"discontinued\" for airports.  \\n- **Geopolitical/Racial Terms:** Link \"surrealist poet\" to \"Paris\" or \"France\" for nationality inference.  \\n- **Operational Details:** Use \"base,\" \"hub,\" or \"operated by\" for aviation/logistics claims.  \\n- **Rankings/Size:** Use \"top 4,\" \"largest,\" or \"4th largest\" for mall/airport rankings.  \\n\\n**Format Your Response as:**  \\n### reasoning: <concise explanation of how the query addresses the claim and documents>  \\n### query: <search query, using quotes for exact phrases, Boolean operators, and parentheses for grouping>  \\n```  \\n\\n### **Additional Tips for Generalizable Strategies:**  \\n- **Check for Synonyms/Related Terms:** If a document mentions \"Robinsons Galleria Cebu,\" include \"Galleria Corporate Center\" or \"SM City Cebu\" as potential synonyms.  \\n- **Prioritize Exact Matches First:** Use quotes for exact phrases (e.g., \"4th largest shopping mall\") to narrow results.  \\n- **Handle Geographical Conflicts:** If a claim contains a geographical inconsistency (e.g., \"Metro Manila in Turkmenistan\"), explicitly include the correct region (e.g., \"Philippines\") to filter documents.  \\n- **Use Parentheses for Grouping:** Structure queries like `\"AirBaltic bases Tallinn Airport AND (VNO ICAO EYVI)\"` to ensure logical grouping.  \\n- **Include Contextual Clues:** For claims with indirect references (e.g., \"airport with IATA: VNO\"), pair terms with related attributes (e.g., \"closed in 2015\" or \"operated by AirBaltic\").'},\n",
       "  {'instruction_prompt': '**Enhanced Instruction for Document Retrieval Based on Claims**  \\n\\n**Task Overview:**  \\nGiven a claim and a set of documents, generate a query to retrieve documents that **directly or indirectly support the claim**. Ensure the query captures all entities, relationships, and contextual details from the claim, while accounting for synonyms, variations, and indirect connections.  \\n\\n**Key Considerations:**  \\n1. **Entity Inclusion:**  \\n   - **List all named entities** explicitly mentioned in the claim, including locations (e.g., \"Howth, County Dublin\") and their **synonyms or alternative names** (e.g., \"village\" OR \"town,\" \"Columbus\" OR \"Chris Columbus\").  \\n   - Use **OR** for alternative spellings, titles, or variations (e.g., \"Marilyn Manson\" OR \"Marilyn Manson\\'s label\").  \\n   - **Include exact names** (e.g., \"Godhead (band)\") and **specific terms** (e.g., \"2000-acre campus\") to avoid ambiguity.  \\n   - **Account for partial names or nicknames** (e.g., \"Rosario Dawson\" OR \"Rosario Isabel Dawson,\" \"Rachael Cook\" OR \"Rachael Leigh Cook\").  \\n\\n2. **Relationships and Context:**  \\n   - **Explicitly structure relationships** (e.g., \"directed by,\" \"formed by\") using precise phrasing (e.g., \"directorial debut\" OR \"first film\").  \\n   - For **indirect connections**, include terms like \"sponsored by,\" \"member of,\" or \"associated with\" to capture documents that may not directly state the relationship (e.g., \"Ford\" as a sponsor of a league).  \\n   - **Prioritize specific terms** (e.g., \"film director,\" \"composer\") over general categories (e.g., \"artist\").  \\n   - **Include exact phrases or titles** from the claim (e.g., \"Yes Minister,\" \"Daredevil (1995)\") to ensure precise matches.  \\n\\n3. **Document Scope and Flexibility:**  \\n   - **Target documents** that mention the claim’s key components, even if they are not the most direct matches (e.g., \"CIT Crawford College of Art and Design\" for \"Cork College of Commerce\").  \\n   - Use **logical operators (AND/OR)** to balance specificity and flexibility. For example, include both the exact entity and its synonyms (e.g., \"University of Florida\" AND \"Chemistry Ph.D.\").  \\n   - **Ensure all key phrases from the claim are explicitly included** (e.g., \"film debut,\" \"co-writer,\" \"1995\") to avoid missing relevant documents.  \\n\\n4. **Handling Comparisons and Conflicts:**  \\n   - For **comparisons** (e.g., \"career duration,\" \"nationality\"), explicitly include both entities in the query (e.g., \"Johannes Lijdius Catharinus Pompe van Meerdervoort\" AND \"Leonard du Bus de Gisignies\").  \\n   - For **potentially conflicting information** (e.g., \"Georgian director\" vs. \"Soviet director\"), include both possibilities to avoid missing relevant documents.  \\n\\n5. **Niche Guidance:**  \\n   - **Include exact names** (e.g., \"Godhead (band)\") and **specific terms** (e.g., \"2000-acre campus\") to avoid ambiguity.  \\n   - For **time-sensitive claims**, explicitly mention dates or eras (e.g., \"1815-1830\" OR \"Bakumatsu period Japan\").  \\n   - **Avoid ambiguity** by using precise terms (e.g., \"sponsored league\" instead of \"football league\").  \\n   - **Test for edge cases** (e.g., documents that mention a location without the full name, like \"Howth\" instead of \"Howth, County Dublin\").  \\n\\n**Example Strategy:**  \\nFor a claim like \"Steven J. Kachelmeier received a Chemistry Ph.D. from a university that is part of the University of Texas System and has over 216,000 students,\" the query should include:  \\n- Exact terms (e.g., \"Steven J. Kachelmeier,\" \"Chemistry Ph.D.,\" \"University of Texas System,\" \"over 216,000 students\").  \\n- Synonyms/alternative names (e.g., \"UT System\" OR \"University of Texas System\").  \\n- Relationships (e.g., \"received Ph.D. from\" OR \"member of\").  \\n- Indirect connections (e.g., \"sponsored league\" for indirect sponsorships).  \\n\\n**Final Query Format:**  \\n### reasoning: <Your reasoning here, explicitly addressing how the query captures all entities, relationships, and nuances from the claim>  \\n### query: <Your query here, structured with precise terms, logical operators, and entity variations>  \\n\\n**Best Practices for Accuracy:**  \\n- **Explicitly include all entities** from the claim (e.g., \"Roger Yuan\" and \"Shanghai Noon\" in Example 2).  \\n- **Use OR for synonyms** (e.g., \"village\" OR \"town\" for locations).  \\n- **Avoid overgeneralization** (e.g., use \"film director\" instead of \"artist\").  \\n- **Prioritize exact names** (e.g., \"LD Beghtol\" instead of \"singer\") to ensure documents are retrieved even if they mention the entity without context.  \\n- **Test for edge cases** (e.g., documents that mention a location without the full name, like \"Howth\" instead of \"Howth, County Dublin\").  \\n- **Include exact phrases or titles** from the claim (e.g., \"Yes Minister,\" \"Daredevil (1995)\") to ensure precise matches.  \\n- **Account for indirect relationships** by including terms like \"co-writer,\" \"co-created,\" or \"associated with\" to capture documents that may not explicitly state the connection.'}],\n",
