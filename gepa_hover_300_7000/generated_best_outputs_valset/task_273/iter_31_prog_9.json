    "full_assistant_response": "### reasoning:  \nThe claim involves three key components:  \n1. **A star of \"The Great White Hype\"** (exact title, actors listed in the document: Samuel L. Jackson, Peter Berg, Damon Wayans, etc.).  \n2. **Played General Pushkin** (exact role name, though not explicitly mentioned in the documents, must be included to capture the claim).  \n3. **Bond film starring Timothy Dalton as Mata Bond** (specific film and character, though the documents clarify that Timothy Dalton played Bond in \"The Living Daylights\" and \"Licence to Kill,\" not Mata Bond, but the query must reflect the claim's phrasing).  \n\nTo ensure precision, the query includes:  \n- **Exact film titles** (\"The Great White Hype\" and \"Bond film\").  \n- **Exact actor names** from \"The Great White Hype\" (OR for all listed stars).  \n- **Exact role** (\"General Pushkin\") and **character** (\"Mata Bond\") as per the claim.  \n- **Logical operators** (AND/OR) to balance specificity and flexibility, e.g., \"Bond film\" to capture any Bond-related document.  \n\n### query:  \n(\"The Great White Hype\" AND (Samuel L. Jackson OR Peter Berg OR Damon Wayans OR Jeff Goldblum OR Jon Lovitz OR Cheech Marin OR John Rhys-Davies OR Salli Richardson OR Jamie Foxx)) AND (General Pushkin) AND (Bond film) AND (Timothy Dalton AND Mata Bond)"
