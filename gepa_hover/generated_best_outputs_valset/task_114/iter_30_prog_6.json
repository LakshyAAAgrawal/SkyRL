    "full_assistant_response": "### reasoning:  \nThe claim specifies a **wooden roller coaster** at **Holiday World**, located in a **theme park divided into four sections**. The documents confirm that **Holiday World & Splashin\u2019 Safari** is a park divided into four sections (Christmas, Halloween, Thanksgiving, Fourth of July) and explicitly lists **\"The Voyage\"** as a **wooden roller coaster** at the park. To ensure precision, the query includes:  \n- **Exact park name** (\"Holiday World & Splashin\u2019 Safari\") to avoid confusion with other parks.  \n- **Specific sections** (Christmas, Halloween, Thanksgiving, Fourth of July) from the documents to match the claim\u2019s \"divided into four sections.\"  \n- **Wooden roller coaster** and **\"The Voyage\"** to target the claim\u2019s focus on a wooden coaster.  \n\nSecondary terms like the park\u2019s location or other coasters (e.g., \"The Legend\") are omitted to avoid overgeneralization. The query prioritizes exact matches from the documents while aligning with the claim\u2019s structure.  \n\n### query:  \n\"wooden roller coaster\" AND \"Holiday World & Splashin' Safari\" AND \"divided into four sections\" AND \"Christmas\" AND \"Halloween\" AND \"Thanksgiving\" AND \"Fourth of July\" AND \"The Voyage\""
