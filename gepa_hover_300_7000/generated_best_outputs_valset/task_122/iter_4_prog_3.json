    "full_assistant_response": "### reasoning:  \nThe claim states that Crosstown Plaza in Schenectady, NY is near a major interstate (I-890, implied by the context of I-90 and Schenectady), and that this interstate (I-890) and I-90 are highways running through Schenectady. Key entities include \"Crosstown Plaza,\" \"Schenectady, NY,\" \"I-890,\" \"I-90,\" and the relationships \"near,\" \"major interstate,\" and \"run through.\" The documents explicitly mention I-890\u2019s proximity to Crosstown Plaza and its connection to I-90, as well as I-890\u2019s route through Schenectady. Synonyms like \"major interstate\" are addressed by including I-890 directly. Relationships are structured to capture proximity and highway connections.  \n\n### query:  \n\"Crosstown Plaza Schenectady NY near Interstate 890\" AND (\"Interstate 890\" OR \"I-890\") AND (\"I-90\" OR \"Interstate 90\") AND (\"run through Schenectady, NY\" OR \"pass through Schenectady\" OR \"highway through Schenectady\") AND (\"major interstate\" OR \"interstate highway\")"
