    "full_assistant_response": "### reasoning:  \nThe claim references a film directed by a former assistant director of Kim Ki-duk, starring Song Kang-ho, selected as South Korea\u2019s 90th Academy Awards entry, and released in 2017. The documents confirm **\"A Taxi Driver\" (2017)** directed by **Jang Hoon**, starring **Song Kang-ho**, and selected as South Korea\u2019s entry for the 90th Academy Awards. However, the documents **do not mention** Jang Hoon\u2019s relationship to Kim Ki-duk. To support the claim, the query must prioritize the confirmed elements (film title, director, actor, release year, Academy entry) while explicitly noting the **lack of evidence** for the director\u2019s connection to Kim Ki-duk.  \n\n### query:  \n\"\\\"A Taxi Driver\\\" Jang Hoon Song Kang-ho 2017 South Korean Academy Awards entry\" AND NOT \"Kim Ki-duk assistant director\""
