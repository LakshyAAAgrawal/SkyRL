    "full_assistant_response": "### reasoning:  \nThe claim states that Bruce Darnell was a jury member for a German talent show that Vanessa Krasniqi participated in, and that he was an American model and choreographer born in 1957. The documents confirm:  \n1. **Vanessa Krasniqi** participated in the German talent show *Deutschland sucht den Superstar* (ninth season) and *Das Supertalent*.  \n2. **Bruce Darnell** is described as an American model and choreographer born in 1957.  \n\nHowever, the documents **do not mention Bruce Darnell being a jury member** for any talent show. Thus, the query must focus on the **specific terms directly supported** by the documents (e.g., exact show titles, birth year, profession) while avoiding unverified connections.  \n\n### query:  \n\"Vanessa Krasniqi AND (Deutschland sucht den Superstar OR Das Supertalent) AND Bruce Darnell AND (born 1957 OR July 19, 1957) AND (model OR choreographer)\""
