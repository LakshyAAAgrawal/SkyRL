    "full_assistant_response": "### reasoning:  \nThe claim specifies two key components:  \n1. A movie tied with \"Anotherloverholenyohead\" for Worst Picture at the **7th Golden Raspberry Awards** (1987).  \n2. The movie stars an **English actress** who won a **1979 BAFTA** for *\"Lillie.\"*  \n\n**Document Analysis**:  \n- The **7th Golden Raspberry Awards** document explicitly states that \"Howard the Duck\" and \"Under the Cherry Moon\" were tied for Worst Picture. However, \"Anotherloverholenyohead\" is not mentioned in any document, suggesting a potential typo or misreference.  \n- The documents do not mention any **English actresses**, **BAFTA awards**, or the film *\"Lillie.\"* This creates a gap in the claim\u2019s verification.  \n\n**Query Strategy**:  \n- Focus on the **7th Razzies** and the tied movies (\"Howard the Duck\" and \"Under the Cherry Moon\") to address the first part.  \n- Search for **English actresses** associated with these films and cross-reference with **1979 BAFTA winners** for *\"Lillie.\"*  \n- Use exact terms from the claim (e.g., \"Anotherloverholenyohead\") and include synonyms/related terms (e.g., \"tied for Worst Picture,\" \"1979 BAFTA\") to capture ambiguity or gaps.  \n\n### query:  \n\"7th Golden Raspberry Awards tied for Worst Picture Anotherloverholenyohead movie English actress 1979 BAFTA Lillie\" AND (\"Howard the Duck\" OR \"Under the Cherry Moon\") AND (\"BAFTA 1979\" OR \"Lillie film\") AND (\"English actress\" OR \"British performer\")"
