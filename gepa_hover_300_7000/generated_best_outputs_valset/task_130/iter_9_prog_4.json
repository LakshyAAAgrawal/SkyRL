    "full_assistant_response": "### reasoning:  \nThe claim links Spencer Lofranco\u2019s co-starring role in the biographical war drama *Unbroken* to the main character being an Olympic distance runner. The documents confirm Lofranco co-starred in *Unbroken* (2014) and identify the film\u2019s subject as Louis Zamperini, a real-life Olympic runner. To support the claim, the query must connect the film\u2019s main character (Zamperini) to Olympic distance running, using exact phrases like \"Unbroken main character\" and \"Olympic distance runner\" while leveraging domain knowledge (e.g., Zamperini\u2019s historical role as an Olympian).  \n\n### query:  \n\"Unbroken main character Olympic distance runner\" OR \"Louis Zamperini Olympic athlete\" OR \"biographical war drama Unbroken Olympic runner\""
