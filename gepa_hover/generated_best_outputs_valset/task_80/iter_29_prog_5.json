    "full_assistant_response": "### reasoning:  \nThe claim asserts that both **Qian'an, Hebei** and the location of **Qing Yan Garden** are Chinese cities. From the documents:  \n- **Qian'an, Hebei** is explicitly stated as a city in Hebei province, under Tangshan City.  \n- **Qing Yan Garden** is located in **Huai'an City, Jiangsu Province, China**.  \nTo support the claim, the query must:  \n1. Explicitly include **Qian'an, Hebei** and **Huai'an City, Jiangsu** as Chinese cities.  \n2. Use domain knowledge (e.g., \"province\" for administrative divisions, \"China\" for country).  \n3. Ensure specificity with terms like \"city\" and \"province\" to avoid ambiguity.  \n\n### query:  \n\"Qian'an, Hebei\" AND \"Huai'an City, Jiangsu\" AND \"China\" AND \"city\" AND \"province\""
