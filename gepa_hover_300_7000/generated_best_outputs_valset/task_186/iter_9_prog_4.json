    "full_assistant_response": "### reasoning:  \nThe claim states that the group associated with Herbert Horne met at Ye Olde Cheshire Cheese in 1999. The documents confirm that the **Rhymers\u2019 Club** met at Ye Olde Cheshire Cheese, but they do not mention Herbert Horne or any group linked to him. To support the claim, the query must explicitly include \"Herbert Horne,\" the year 1999, and the location \"Ye Olde Cheshire Cheese.\" Since the documents lack direct evidence of Herbert Horne\u2019s group, the query prioritizes exact phrases and Boolean operators to narrow results to this specific context.  \n\n### query:  \n\"Herbert Horne group met Ye Olde Cheshire Cheese 1999\" OR \"Herbert Horne associated group Ye Olde Cheshire Cheese 1999\" OR \"Herbert Horne 1999 Ye Olde Cheshire Cheese\""
