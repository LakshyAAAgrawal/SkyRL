    "full_assistant_response": "### reasoning:  \nThe claim specifies three key elements: (1) Vikram (actor) played a lead role in the original film that *Ranja* is a remake of (i.e., *Dhool*), and (2) Vikram was awarded an Honorary Doctorate by the People's University of Milan. The documents confirm Vikram's honorary doctorate and identify *Ranja* as a remake of *Dhool*. However, no document explicitly states Vikram (actor) was in *Dhool*. To ensure specificity, the query must explicitly link Vikram to *Dhool* (the original film of *Ranja*) and include the honorary doctorate.  \n\n### query:  \n\"Vikram (actor) lead role in Dhool (2003 Tamil film) and Honorary Doctorate awarded by People's University of Milan\""
