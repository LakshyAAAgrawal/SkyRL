    "full_assistant_response": "### reasoning:  \nThe query incorporates **specific terms from the claim** (e.g., \"Sara Eskander Poulsen,\" \"voiced an animated character,\" \"The Suite Life of Zack & Cody\") and **document-specific entities** (e.g., \"Phineas and Ferb,\" \"Candace Flynn,\" \"London Tipton,\" \"Brenda Song\") to ensure precision. It avoids general terms like \"actress\" or \"success\" and instead uses **explicit relationships** (e.g., \"dubbing,\" \"voiced\") and **secondary details** (e.g., \"Phineas and Ferb\") from the documents to capture relevant evidence. The inclusion of \"Brenda Song\" and \"dubbing\" ensures alignment with the document's mention of her role in dubbing London Tipton.  \n\n### query:  \n\"Sara Eskander Poulsen\" AND \"The Suite Life of Zack & Cody\" AND \"London Tipton\" AND \"dubbing\" AND \"Phineas and Ferb\" AND \"Candace Flynn\" AND \"Brenda Song\""
