    "full_assistant_response": "### reasoning:  \nThe claim identifies an actor who (1) starred in an Oscar-winning film with Amber Tamblyn and (2) also starred in *Pineapple Express*. To retrieve supporting documents:  \n- **Amber Tamblyn** is explicitly named in the documents, so her exact name must be included.  \n- **Oscar-winning film** must be linked to her, but the documents do not explicitly name an Oscar-winning film she starred in. However, *127 Hours* (2010) is widely recognized as an Oscar-winning film in which she appeared, though this is not stated in the documents. To account for indirect connections, the query includes \"Oscar-winning film\" and \"127 Hours\" as potential candidates.  \n- The **actor** must be identified as someone who appeared in both the Oscar-winning film and *Pineapple Express*. Since the documents do not explicitly name the actor, the query includes both \"actor\" and specific film titles (*Pineapple Express*) to capture indirect matches.  \n- **Logical operators (AND/OR)** balance specificity (e.g., \"Oscar-winning film\") and flexibility (e.g., \"127 Hours\" OR \"Oscar-winning film\").  \n\n### query:  \nAmber Tamblyn AND (127 Hours OR \"127 Hours\" OR \"Oscar-winning film\") AND (actor OR \"actor in film\") AND (Pineapple Express OR \"Pineapple Express\" OR \"film starring actor\")"
