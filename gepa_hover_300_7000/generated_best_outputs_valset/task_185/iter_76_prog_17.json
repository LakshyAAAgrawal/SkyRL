    "full_assistant_response": "### reasoning:  \nThe claim asserts that Alter Bridge's lead vocalist (Myles Kennedy), who co-wrote \"Rise Today,\" and SafetySuit are both associated with rock bands. The documents confirm Alter Bridge is a rock band and Myles Kennedy co-wrote \"Rise Today\" (as stated in the first and third documents). However, **SafetySuit is not mentioned in the documents**, so the query must explicitly address this gap. To ensure comprehensiveness, the query includes terms for both entities, uses Boolean operators to combine relationships, and incorporates exact phrases for precision.  \n\n### query:  \n(\"Alter Bridge lead vocalist co-wrote Rise Today\" AND \"rock band\") AND (\"SafetySuit rock band\" OR \"SafetySuit associated with rock bands\")  \n\n**Key Adjustments:**  \n- **Exact phrases** like \"Rise Today\" and \"rock band\" ensure specificity.  \n- **Boolean operators** (`AND`, `OR`) link the two entities (Alter Bridge/SafetySuit) and their relationships.  \n- **SafetySuit** is explicitly included to address the claim\u2019s second part, even though the documents lack direct references.  \n- **Synonyms** like \"associated with\" cover potential indirect mentions."
