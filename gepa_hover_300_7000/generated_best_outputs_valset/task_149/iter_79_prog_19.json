    "full_assistant_response": "### reasoning:  \nThe claim asserts that the band who released \"My Type\" was an Elektra Records indie pop group. To validate this, we must:  \n1. **Identify Entities**: The key entities are the band (unknown name), \"My Type\" (song/album), Elektra Records, and the genre \"indie pop.\"  \n2. **Check Document Coverage**:  \n   - **\"My Type\"**: Not explicitly mentioned in any document.  \n   - **Elektra Records**: Mentioned in the context of Saint Motel's *Saintmotelevision* album (2016) and Fitz and The Tantrums' *HandClap* (2016).  \n   - **Indie Pop**: Explicitly referenced in the *Family Records* document (independent label) and in the *New Record by My Bloody Valentine* (indie pop influence).  \n   - **Band Names**: No document directly links a band to \"My Type.\"  \n3. **Gaps**: The absence of \"My Type\" in the documents creates ambiguity. However, Saint Motel (indie pop) and Fitz and The Tantrums (indie pop) are linked to Elektra.  \n4. **Domain-Specific Terms**: Use \"Elektra Records,\" \"indie pop,\" and exact song/album names (e.g., *Saintmotelevision*, *HandClap*) to avoid overgeneralization.  \n\n### query:  \n(\"My Type\" AND \"Elektra Records\" AND \"indie pop\") OR (\"Saint Motel\" AND \"Elektra Records\" AND \"indie pop\") OR (\"Fitz and The Tantrums\" AND \"Elektra Records\" AND \"indie pop\")  \n\n### Key Niche Strategies:  \n- **Ambiguity Resolution**: Since \"My Type\" is unmentioned, prioritize bands explicitly tied to Elektra and indie pop (e.g., Saint Motel, Fitz and The Tantrums).  \n- **Exact Matches**: Use \"Saintmotelevision\" (Saint Motel's Elektra album) and \"HandClap\" (Fitz and The Tantrums' Elektra single) to align with document terminology.  \n- **Genre Alignment**: Explicitly include \"indie pop\" to match the claim\u2019s genre requirement."
