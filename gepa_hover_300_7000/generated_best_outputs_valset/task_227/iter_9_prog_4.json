    "full_assistant_response": "### reasoning:  \nThe claim states that the star of *Into the Dalek* (a *Doctor Who* episode) also played Mr. Curry in *Paddington 2*. The documents confirm **Peter Capaldi** played Mr. Curry in *Paddington* and is set to reprise the role in *Paddington 2*. Additionally, Capaldi is explicitly noted as the twelfth Doctor in *Doctor Who*, including the episode *Into the Dalek*. The query must link Capaldi to both roles using exact phrases and domain-specific terms like \"Doctor Who\" and \"Paddington 2.\"  \n\n### query:  \n\"Peter Capaldi Into the Dalek\" AND \"Mr Curry Paddington 2\" OR \"Peter Capaldi Doctor Who Into the Dalek\" AND \"Paddington 2 Mr Curry\""
