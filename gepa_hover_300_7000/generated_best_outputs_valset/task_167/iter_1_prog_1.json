    "full_assistant_response": "### reasoning:  \nThe claim compares David Michael Draiman's birth date (March 13, 1973) to the birth date of the vocalist of \"Make Me Smile.\" The documents confirm Draiman's birth date but do not explicitly state the vocalist of \"Make Me Smile\" or their birth date. However, the song \"Make Me Smile\" by Chicago (1970) is attributed to Terry Kath as lead vocalist. The query must identify Terry Kath and retrieve his birth date to validate the claim. Since the documents lack this information, the query prioritizes terms like \"Terry Kath\" and \"birth date\" to find supporting evidence.  \n\n### query:  \n\"vocalist of Make Me Smile birth date\" AND \"Terry Kath\" AND \"born\""
