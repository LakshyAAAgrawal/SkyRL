    "full_assistant_response": "### reasoning:  \nThe claim states that **Arola SARL became part of another group in 1983** and that the **company that purchased that group is based in Roseau, Minnesota, USA**.  \n\n1. **Analyze the Claim**:  \n   - **Entities**: Arola SARL, the group it joined (Aixam), and the purchasing company (unknown in the documents).  \n   - **Attributes**: Year 1983, \"became part of a group,\" and \"based in Roseau, Minnesota, USA.\"  \n   - **Relationships**: Arola SARL \u2192 joined group \u2192 purchased by company in Roseau, MN.  \n\n2. **Cross-Reference with Documents**:  \n   - The first document confirms **Arola SARL became part of the Aixam group in 1983**.  \n   - However, **no document explicitly states where Aixam is based**. The second document mentions **Polaris Industries**, based in Roseau, Minnesota, but there is **no direct link between Polaris and Aixam** in the provided texts.  \n\n3. **Identify Key Search Terms**:  \n   - Precise terms: \"Arola SARL,\" \"1983,\" \"group,\" \"Roseau, Minnesota, USA.\"  \n   - Synonyms: \"joined,\" \"acquired,\" \"purchased,\" \"based in.\"  \n\n4. **Address Ambiguity or Missing Entities**:  \n   - The documents do not clarify whether Aixam is the same as the company in Roseau, Minnesota. The query must explicitly link the two.  \n\n5. **Structure the Query**:  \n   - Combine terms to target both parts of the claim: Arola SARL\u2019s 1983 acquisition and the purchasing company\u2019s location.  \n   - Use logical connectors to ensure both components are addressed.  \n\n6. **Include Domain-Specific Context**:  \n   - Use exact terms like \"Aixam group\" (from the first document) and \"Roseau, Minnesota, USA\" to avoid ambiguity.  \n\n7. **Avoid Overgeneralization**:  \n   - Focus on specific phrases like \"based in Roseau, Minnesota, USA\" to match the claim precisely.  \n\n### query:  \n\"Arola SARL AND (1983 OR 1983) AND (joined OR acquired) AND (group OR company) AND (based in OR located in) Roseau, Minnesota, USA\""
