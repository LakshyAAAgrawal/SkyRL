    "full_assistant_response": "### reasoning: The claim asserts that Scott Shepherd's movies do not feature Rudolf Abel, a Soviet intelligence officer. The documents confirm Scott Shepherd's filmography (\"Bridge of Spies\", \"Side Effects\", \"Jason Bourne\") and Rudolf Abel's identity (real name William Fisher). To support the claim, the query must verify that none of Scott Shepherd's movies include Rudolf Abel as a cast member. Since the documents do not mention Rudolf Abel\u2019s filmography, the absence of evidence aligns with the claim. The query should explicitly include Scott Shepherd\u2019s movies, Rudolf Abel\u2019s aliases, and ensure no overlap in cast listings. \n\n### query: Scott Shepherd (actor) AND (Bridge of Spies OR Side Effects OR Jason Bourne) AND (Rudolf Abel OR William Fisher) AND NOT (cast member OR starring)"
