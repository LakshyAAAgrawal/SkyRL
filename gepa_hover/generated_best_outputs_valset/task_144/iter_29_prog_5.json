    "full_assistant_response": "### reasoning:  \nThe claim identifies two key components:  \n1. **Album after \"Parachutes\"**: The album \"Parachutes\" (2000) contains a song referencing Chris Martin's unrequited love (\"Yellow\"). The next album in Coldplay's discography is \"A Rush of Blood to the Head\" (2002), which includes \"The Scientist.\"  \n2. **Song \"The Scientist\"**: This track is explicitly tied to the album \"A Rush of Blood to the Head.\"  \n\nTo construct the query:  \n- **Explicit terms**: \"Coldplay,\" \"Parachutes,\" \"The Scientist.\"  \n- **Implicit terms**: \"album after Parachutes,\" \"song,\" \"track.\"  \n- **Domain knowledge**: Use \"album\" and \"track\" for specificity, and prioritize \"Coldplay\" to avoid ambiguity.  \n\n### query:  \n(Coldplay AND (album after Parachutes) AND The Scientist) OR (Coldplay AND \"A Rush of Blood to the Head\" AND The Scientist)"
