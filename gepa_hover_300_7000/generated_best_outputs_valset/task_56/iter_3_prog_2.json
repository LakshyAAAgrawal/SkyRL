    "full_assistant_response": "### reasoning:  \nThe claim states that the three best sellers from the author of *Detective (novel)* released before Donna Tartt's birth in 1963 are *Hotel* (1965), *Airport* (1968), and *Wheels* (1971). The documents identify Arthur Hailey as the author of *Hotel*, *Airport*, and *Wheels*, which are best sellers. However, the documents do not explicitly mention *Detective (novel)* as one of Hailey\u2019s works. The claim assumes that the author of *Detective (novel)* is the same as the author of the three books listed, but this link is not directly supported by the documents. To address this gap, the query must explicitly connect the author of *Detective (novel)* to the three books and verify their publication dates (before 1963). Since the documents do not clarify the authorship of *Detective (novel)*, the query must focus on the three books and their authorship to infer the author of *Detective (novel)*.  \n\n### query:  \n\"Author of 'Detective (novel)' AND 'Hotel' (1965), 'Airport' (1968), 'Wheels' (1971) AND released before 1963\""
