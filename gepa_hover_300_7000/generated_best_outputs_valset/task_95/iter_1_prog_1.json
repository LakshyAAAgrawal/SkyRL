    "full_assistant_response": "### reasoning:  \nThe claim links James Bridges to co-writing a script for a movie starring John Travolta, which was parodied by *Urban Chipmunk*, the first country album by Alvin and the Chipmunks. Documents confirm that *Urban Chipmunk* parodies *Urban Cowboy* (1980), and that James Bridges co-wrote *Urban Cowboy* with Aaron Latham. John Travolta starred in *Urban Cowboy*. The query must explicitly connect these elements: James Bridges, *Urban Cowboy*, John Travolta, *Urban Chipmunk*, and the parody relationship.  \n\n### query:  \n\"James Bridges co-wrote script Urban Cowboy\" AND \"Urban Chipmunk first country album parody Urban Cowboy\" AND \"John Travolta\""
