    "full_assistant_response": "### reasoning:  \nThe claim identifies **General John J. Pershing** as the commander of the **American Expeditionary Force (AEF)** on the **Western Front** during World War I, emphasizing his role in leading **American and French troops** against German positions. Key specific terms include:  \n- **\"American Expeditionary Force (AEF)\"** and **\"Western Front\"** (explicitly tied to Pershing\u2019s command).  \n- **\"3rd Pursuit Group\"** as a supporting unit during battles like the **Meuse-Argonne Offensive** (a major AEF operation under Pershing).  \n- **\"Battle of Saint-Mihiel\"** and **\"Meuse-Argonne Offensive\"** (specific battles where the AEF, under Pershing, engaged German forces).  \n- **\"John J. Pershing\"** as the central entity, with his most famous post directly linked to AEF command.  \n\nTo avoid overgeneralization, the query must include **exact terms** like \"John J. Pershing,\" \"American Expeditionary Force,\" \"Western Front,\" \"Meuse-Argonne Offensive,\" and \"3rd Pursuit Group\" to target documents that explicitly connect these elements.  \n\n### query:  \n\"John J. Pershing\" AND \"American Expeditionary Force (AEF)\" AND \"Western Front\" AND (\"Meuse-Argonne Offensive\" OR \"Battle of Saint-Mihiel\") AND \"3rd Pursuit Group\""
