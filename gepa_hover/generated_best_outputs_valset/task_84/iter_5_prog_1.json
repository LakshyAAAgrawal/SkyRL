    "full_assistant_response": "### reasoning:  \nThe claim identifies an American actress (born in 1922) who worked on \"Golden Girls\" and played Estelle Getty's daughter. From the documents:  \n1. **Estelle Getty** is explicitly linked to \"Golden Girls\" (born 1923).  \n2. **Bea Arthur** is stated to have played Dorothy Zbornak (Estelle Getty's character's daughter) and was \"a year older than Getty.\" This confirms Bea Arthur was born in 1922.  \n3. The documents directly mention \"Bea Arthur\" and \"Estelle Getty\" in the context of \"Golden Girls\" and their age relationship.  \n\nTo ensure precision:  \n- Use **specific names** (\"Bea Arthur,\" \"Estelle Getty\") and **exact terms** (\"Golden Girls,\" \"year older\") from the documents.  \n- Avoid vague terms like \"born in 1922\" unless explicitly stated (which it isn\u2019t for Bea Arthur, but the relationship allows inference).  \n\n### query:  \n\"Bea Arthur\" AND \"Estelle Getty\" AND \"Golden Girls\" AND \"year older\""
