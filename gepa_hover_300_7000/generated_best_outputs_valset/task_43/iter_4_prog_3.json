    "full_assistant_response": "### reasoning: The claim identifies a German-born philologist (Max M\u00fcller) and an Indologist (Heinrich Zimmer) who coexisted in Indian Philology. The query must include: 1) \"German-born philologist\" and \"lived in Britain\" for Max M\u00fcller; 2) \"Indologist\" and \"coined the term National Institute of Science, Technology and Development\" for the second scholar. Since the term \"National Institute of Science, Technology and Development\" is unique to the claim, it must be explicitly included. Heinrich Zimmer is directly linked to Max M\u00fcller in the documents, and the term is critical for matching the Indologist.  \n### query: (German-born philologist AND lived in Britain) AND (Indologist AND coined the term \"National Institute of Science, Technology and Development\") AND (Max M\u00fcller OR Heinrich Zimmer)"
