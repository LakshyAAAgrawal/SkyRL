    "full_assistant_response": "### reasoning:  \nThe claim links two entities: the electropop group associated with \"Get Sharp\" (The Limousines) and Faith No More. The key relationship is their shared origin in a western state. Documents confirm Faith No More is based in San Francisco (California), a western state. However, no document explicitly states The Limousines' location. To support the claim, the query must verify if The Limousines are also from California. Since the documents do not mention The Limousines' location, the query focuses on the explicit connection between Faith No More and San Francisco, while prioritizing specific terms like \"The Limousines\" and \"Faith No More\" to target relevant documents.  \n\n### query:  \n\"The Limousines\" AND \"Faith No More\" AND \"San Francisco\" AND \"California\""
