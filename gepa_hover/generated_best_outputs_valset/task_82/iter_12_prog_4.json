    "full_assistant_response": "### reasoning:  \nThe claim refers to the conference that Shannon Doyle's team (Colgate Raiders women's ice hockey) played in, which used to be affiliated with the Eastern College Athletic Conference (ECAC). From the documents:  \n1. **Core Entities**: Shannon Doyle's team is the Colgate Raiders women's ice hockey program (2010\u201312).  \n2. **Relationships**: The claim links the team's conference to ECAC. While the documents do not explicitly state the conference for the Colgate Raiders, the ECAC is mentioned as an affiliate of other conferences (e.g., EAWRC, EIGL, EARC). The claim likely assumes the Colgate Raiders were part of ECAC, which is a known NCAA conference.  \n3. **Indirect Connections**: The ECAC's affiliation with other conferences (e.g., EAWRC, EIGL) and the term \"affiliate\" in the documents suggest the need to explicitly include \"affiliate\" and \"ECAC\" to capture historical links.  \n4. **Secondary Context**: The time frame (2010\u201312) and the team (Colgate Raiders) are critical to narrow results.  \n\n### query:  \n\"Colgate Raiders women's ice hockey\" AND \"Eastern College Athletic Conference\" AND \"affiliate\" AND \"2010\u201312\""
