    "full_assistant_response": "### reasoning:  \nThe claim identifies three key figures: George Whitefield, John Wesley, and an Anglican priest who worked with Edward Perronet, all linked to the 18th-century origin of Methodism within the Church of England. The documents confirm that John Wesley and George Whitefield were central to the movement, while Edward Perronet\u2019s father (an Anglican priest) collaborated with Wesley and Charles Wesley. The claim\u2019s reference to \"the Anglican priest who worked with Edward Perronet\" likely conflates Edward Perronet\u2019s father (explicitly mentioned in the documents) with the priest in the claim. To ensure accuracy, the query must explicitly include all three names and the 18th-century context, avoiding vague terms like \"Anglican priest\" unless directly tied to Edward Perronet.  \n\n### query:  \n\"George Whitefield AND John Wesley AND Edward Perronet AND 18th century AND Church of England\""
