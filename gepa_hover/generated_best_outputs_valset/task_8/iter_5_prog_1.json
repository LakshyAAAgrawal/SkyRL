    "full_assistant_response": "### reasoning:  \nThe claim links **Jairos Jiri** (philanthropist in Rhodesia/Zimbabwe) to **facilities created in the 1940s** for disadvantaged/disabled people, with the **capital Salisbury** (Rhodesia) hosting the **Currie Cup** where **John David McPhun** played. Key entities:  \n- **Jairos Jiri** (philanthropist, Rhodesia/Zimbabwe, 1940s facilities).  \n- **Salisbury** (capital of Rhodesia/Zimbabwe).  \n- **Currie Cup** (South African rugby competition, but documents mention Rhodesia\u2019s participation).  \n- **John David McPhun** (born in Salisbury, Rhodesia, played for Rhodesia in Currie Cup).  \n\nDocuments explicitly tie **Jairos Jiri** to **Rhodesia/Zimbabwe** (now Zimbabwe), **Salisbury** as the capital, and **John McPhun** to the **Currie Cup** in Rhodesia. The query must prioritize precise terms like **\"Jairos Jiri\"**, **\"facilities 1940s\"**, **\"Rhodesia/Zimbabwe\"**, **\"Salisbury\"**, **\"Currie Cup\"**, and **\"John David McPhun\"** to ensure specificity.  \n\n### query:  \n\"Jairos Jiri facilities 1940s Rhodesia/Zimbabwe\" AND \"Currie Cup John David McPhun Salisbury\""
