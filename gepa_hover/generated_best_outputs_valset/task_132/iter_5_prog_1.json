    "full_assistant_response": "### reasoning:  \nThe claim asserts that the **Can de Palleiro** is a Galician breed unrelated to the **Old English Bulldog**'s lineage in creating the **Boxer**. Key entities include:  \n- **Can de Palleiro** (Galician Shepherd Dog, originating in Galicia)  \n- **Old English Bulldog** (extinct breed used in Boxer breeding)  \n- **Boxer** (breed developed via crossbreeding Old English Bulldog and Bullenbeisser)  \n\nTo support the claim, the query must:  \n1. Confirm **Can de Palleiro**'s origin in **Galicia** (specific term).  \n2. Link **Old English Bulldog** to **Boxer** (explicit relationship).  \n3. Avoid vague terms like \"dog breed\" and instead use precise terms like \"Can de Palleiro\" and \"Old English Bulldog.\"  \n\n### query:  \n\"Can de Palleiro\" AND \"Galicia\" AND (\"Old English Bulldog\" OR \"Bullenbeisser\") AND \"Boxer (dog)\"  \n\nThis query explicitly targets documents confirming the Can de Palleiro's Galician origin and the Old English Bulldog's role in Boxer breeding, ensuring no overlap between the two breeds."
