    "full_assistant_response": "### reasoning:  \nThe claim identifies a German-born philologist (Max M\u00fcller) who lived in Britain and is a key figure in Indian Philology, alongside an Indologist (Heinrich Zimmer) who coined the term \"Traanstheism.\" The documents confirm Max M\u00fcller as the German-born philologist in Britain and note Heinrich Zimmer as the most important German scholar in Indian Philology after M\u00fcller. While \"Traanstheism\" is not explicitly mentioned, the term \"Transtheism\" (a concept M\u00fcller popularized) is relevant. The query must combine precise terms like \"German-born philologist,\" \"Britain,\" \"Indian Philology,\" and \"Indologist\" while addressing the term \"Traanstheism\" (assuming a typo for \"Transtheism\").  \n\n### query:  \n\"German-born philologist Britain Indian Philology Indologist Traanstheism\" OR \"Max M\u00fcller\" OR \"Heinrich Zimmer\" OR \"Transtheism\""
