    "full_assistant_response": "### reasoning: The claim conflates Scadoxus and Enkianthus campanulatus, asserting the latter is the hardiest species small enough for tiny containers. While documents confirm Enkianthus campanulatus is the hardiest in its genus, they do not mention container suitability. The query prioritizes key terms from the claim (e.g., \"hardiest species,\" \"tiny containers\") to target relevant documents, even if the connection is indirect.  \n### query: \"Enkianthus campanulatus hardiest species\" AND \"grown in tiny containers\""
