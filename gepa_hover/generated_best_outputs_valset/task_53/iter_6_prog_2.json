    "full_assistant_response": "### reasoning:  \nThe claim specifies a film directed by a former assistant director of Kim Ki-duk, starring Song Kang-ho in the title role, selected as the South Korean entry for the 90th Academy Awards, and debuting in 2017. The documents confirm \"A Taxi Driver\" (2017) directed by Jang Hoon, starring Song Kang-ho, and selected as South Korea\u2019s Academy entry. However, the claim\u2019s reference to Kim Ki-duk\u2019s former assistant director is unverified in the documents. To align with the claim, the query must explicitly include all key elements: the film\u2019s title, director (Jang Hoon), Song Kang-ho\u2019s role, the 2017 debut, and the Academy entry. The connection to Kim Ki-duk is inferred as part of the claim, even if not directly supported by the documents.  \n\n### query:  \n\"A Taxi Driver, directed by Jang Hoon (a former assistant director of Kim Ki-duk), starring Song Kang-ho in the title role, selected as the South Korean entry for the Best Foreign Language Film at the 90th Academy Awards, and debuted in 2017.\""
