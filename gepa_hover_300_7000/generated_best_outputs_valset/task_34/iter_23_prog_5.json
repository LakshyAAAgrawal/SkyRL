    "full_assistant_response": "### reasoning: The claim involves an American actress who performed \"Take On The World\" with Sabrina Carpenter and was a star of *Invisible Sister*. Key entities include \"Sabrina Carpenter,\" \"Take On The World,\" and \"Invisible Sister.\" The documents mention Sabrina Carpenter's work but not \"Take On The World.\" However, *Invisible Sister* stars Rowan Blanchard and Paris Berelc. The query must capture the relationship between the actress (star of *Invisible Sister*) and Sabrina Carpenter (collaboration on \"Take On The World\"). Since the song isn't in the documents, the query focuses on the explicit entities and relationships from the claim, prioritizing precision for the film and artist names.  \n### query: (\"Take On The World\" AND \"Sabrina Carpenter\" AND \"performed with\" AND \"American actress\") AND (\"Invisible Sister\" AND \"star\" OR \"starring\" OR \"cast\") AND (\"Rowan Blanchard\" OR \"Paris Berelc\")"
