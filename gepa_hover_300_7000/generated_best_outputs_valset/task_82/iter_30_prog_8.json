    "full_assistant_response": "### reasoning:  \nThe claim asserts that the conference Shannon Doyle's team (Colgate Raiders women's ice hockey, 2010\u201312) belonged to was affiliated with the **Eastern College Athletic Conference (ECAC)**. To validate this, we must:  \n1. **Identify entities**: Shannon Doyle, Colgate Raiders (team), 2010\u201312 (timeframe), ECAC (conference).  \n2. **Analyze document gaps**:  \n   - The first document confirms Shannon Doyle's affiliation with the **Colgate Raiders** (NCAA Division I women's ice hockey) from 2010\u201312 but does **not explicitly name the conference**.  \n   - The documents list **ECAC affiliates** (e.g., Eastern Association of Women's Rowing Colleges, Eastern Intercollegiate Gymnastics League) but do **not directly link Colgate's conference** to ECAC.  \n   - The claim hinges on the **affiliation of the conference** (Colgate's conference) with ECAC, which is **not explicitly stated** in the documents.  \n3. **Prioritize exact matches**: Use \"Colgate Raiders women's ice hockey\" and \"2010\u201312\" to narrow the timeframe. For the ECAC affiliation, use \"affiliate of Eastern College Athletic Conference\" or \"ECAC affiliate.\"  \n4. **Address gaps**: Since the documents lack direct confirmation, the query must explicitly target **Colgate's conference** and its **affiliation with ECAC**.  \n\n### query:  \n(\"Shannon Doyle Colgate Raiders women's ice hockey 2010\u201312 conference\" AND (\"affiliate of Eastern College Athletic Conference\" OR \"ECAC affiliate\"))  \nOR  \n(\"Colgate Raiders women's ice hockey conference\" AND (\"Eastern College Athletic Conference\" OR \"ECAC\"))  \nOR  \n(\"Eastern College Athletic Conference\" AND \"Colgate Raiders\" AND \"2010\u201312\")  \n\nThis query systematically checks for:  \n- The specific team (Colgate Raiders) and timeframe (2010\u201312).  \n- Explicit mentions of the conference's affiliation with ECAC.  \n- Direct links between \"Colgate\" and \"ECAC\" to resolve gaps."
