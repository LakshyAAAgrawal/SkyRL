    "full_assistant_response": "### reasoning:  \nThe claim specifies two key elements: (1) the original run of an HBO show with 94 episodes and (2) the voice actress of *Miss Spider* not playing *Charlotte York Goldenblatt*. From the documents:  \n- *Charlotte York Goldenblatt* is a character in *Sex and the City* (1998\u20132004), portrayed by **Kristin Davis**.  \n- *Miss Spider* is a character in the *Miss Spider's Sunny Patch Friends* series, voiced by **Kristin Davis** (per the Miss Spider document).  \n- The original run of *Sex and the City* (1998\u20132004) is explicitly mentioned, but the document does not state the total episode count. However, the claim assumes 94 episodes, which aligns with the show\u2019s actual runtime (6 seasons \u00d7 13 episodes = 78 episodes, but the claim may reference a broader context).  \n\nTo support the claim, the query must explicitly link **Kristin Davis** (voice actress of *Miss Spider*) to the HBO show where she **did not** play *Charlotte York Goldenblatt*. Since the documents confirm she *did* play *Charlotte York Goldenblatt*, the query must focus on the **HBO show\u2019s episode count** and the **voice actress\u2019s role** in *Miss Spider* to exclude her from *Charlotte York Goldenblatt*.  \n\n### query:  \n\"HBO show with 94 episodes where the voice actress of *Miss Spider* (Kristin Davis) did not play *Charlotte York Goldenblatt* (1998\u20132004)\""
