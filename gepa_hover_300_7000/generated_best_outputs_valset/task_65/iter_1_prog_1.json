    "full_assistant_response": "### reasoning:  \nThe claim identifies Ernst & Young as a London-based \"Big Four\" firm and links it to being a tenant in East Asia's hub, where InfoPark Thrissur is a spoke. The documents confirm EY's headquarters in London and its status as a \"Big Four\" firm. However, no document explicitly connects EY to East Asia or InfoPark Thrissur. The query must include precise terms from the claim (e.g., \"Ernst & Young,\" \"London,\" \"Big Four\") and related terms (e.g., \"tenant,\" \"East Asia,\" \"spoke\") to retrieve relevant documents. Since no document directly supports the East Asia/InfoPark Thrissur link, the query prioritizes the confirmed elements while including the claim\u2019s specific relationships.  \n\n### query:  \n\"Ernst & Young headquarters London\" AND \"Big Four accounting firms\" AND \"tenant East Asia\" AND \"InfoPark Thrissur spoke\""
