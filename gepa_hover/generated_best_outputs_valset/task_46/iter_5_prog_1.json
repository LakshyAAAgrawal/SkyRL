    "full_assistant_response": "### reasoning:  \nThe claim connects **High Plains** to the **Morrison Formation** and the **Woodbine Formation**, specifying that the **Woodbine Formation overlies** the area. Key entities are **High Plains**, **Morrison Formation**, and **Woodbine Formation**. The documents mention:  \n- **Morrison Formation** in *Como Bluff* (Wyoming, part of the High Plains).  \n- **Woodbine Formation** in east Texas (part of the High Plains) and its stratigraphic position.  \n- **High Plains** as a subregion of the Great Plains, overlapping with the geographic scope of the Morrison and Woodbine formations.  \n\nTo ensure precision, the query must explicitly include **High Plains**, **Morrison Formation**, and **Woodbine Formation**, as these are the exact terms used in the documents. The term \"overlies\" is implied in the Woodbine Formation's description but not explicitly stated in the documents.  \n\n### query:  \n\"High Plains\" AND \"Morrison Formation\" AND \"Woodbine Formation\""
