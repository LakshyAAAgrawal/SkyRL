    "full_assistant_response": "### reasoning:  \nThe claim asserts that Franklin \"Pete\" Adreon is still alive, conflating him with a \"teen actor\" who starred with Shareeka Epps in *Half Nelson*. The documents clarify:  \n1. **Franklin Adreon**: Born 1902, died 1979 (document 3). This directly contradicts the claim of him being alive.  \n2. **Shareeka Epps**: Starred in *Half Nelson* (2006) with Ryan Gosling and Anthony Mackie (documents 1 and 2). No \"teen actor\" is explicitly mentioned in this context.  \n3. **Pete Ploszek**: A teen actor (born 1987) associated with *Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles* and *Teen Wolf* (document 6), but not linked to *Half Nelson*.  \n\nAmbiguity arises from the name \"Pete\" (Franklin \"Pete\" Adreon vs. Pete Ploszek). To resolve this, the query must distinguish between the deceased director (Franklin Adreon) and the living actor (Pete Ploszek), while confirming the absence of a \"teen actor\" in *Half Nelson*.  \n\n### query:  \n\"Franklin Adreon\" AND (\"November 18, 1902\" OR \"died 1979\") AND NOT (\"Pete Ploszek\" OR \"1987\") AND (\"Half Nelson\" AND \"Shareeka Epps\" AND \"Ryan Gosling\" AND \"Anthony Mackie\" AND NOT \"teen actor\")"
