    "full_assistant_response": "### reasoning:  \nThe claim identifies two colonies (New York and New Jersey) involved in skirmishes between 1701\u20131765, with New York transitioning from a proprietary to a royal colony. The documents confirm the New York\u2013New Jersey Line War (Document 1) and New York\u2019s status as a proprietary colony that became royal (Document 2). While John Cruger Jr. is not explicitly mentioned in the documents, the query includes his name as part of the claim\u2019s key entity. The query prioritizes terms like \"New York\u2013New Jersey Line War,\" \"British proprietary colony,\" \"royal colony,\" and \"northeast coast\" to align with the claim\u2019s specifics, ensuring relevance to the documents.  \n\n### query:  \n\"John Cruger Jr. New York New Jersey Line War 1701-1765 British proprietary colony royal colony northeast coast\""
