    "full_assistant_response": "### reasoning:  \nThe claim states that David William Oxtoby was the ninth president of an educational institution and that Brown University was founded before this institution. From the documents, it is clear that Oxtoby served as the ninth president of **Pomona College** (not explicitly stated in the documents, but inferred from the context of his role as a college president). Brown University was founded in **1764**, while Pomona College was established later (though the exact date is not provided in the documents). To directly support the claim, the query must explicitly name **Pomona College** as the institution Oxtoby led, include **Brown University's founding year (1764)**, and ensure the temporal relationship between the two is clarified.  \n\n### query:  \n\"David William Oxtoby, ninth president of Pomona College, and Brown University, founded in 1764, was established before the founding of Pomona College.\""
