    "full_assistant_response": "### reasoning:  \nThe claim states that the Seton Hall Pirates and another team play at the same venue as *Extreme Rules (2016)*. The documents confirm that the Seton Hall Pirates played home games at the **Prudential Center in Newark, New Jersey** (e.g., 2016\u201317 season). However, the documents do not explicitly mention *Extreme Rules (2016)* or its venue. To resolve this, the query must focus on the **Prudential Center** as the shared location and explicitly link it to both the Seton Hall Pirates and another team. Since the documents do not name a second team, the query should prioritize the venue and the Pirates, while allowing for indirect connections (e.g., other teams in the Big East Conference that also use the Prudential Center).  \n\n### query:  \n\"Seton Hall Pirates and another team play at the Prudential Center in Newark, New Jersey, same as Extreme Rules (2016)\""
