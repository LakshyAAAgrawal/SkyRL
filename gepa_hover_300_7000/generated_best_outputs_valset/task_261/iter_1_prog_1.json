    "full_assistant_response": "### reasoning:  \nThe claim asserts that the director of *The Object of My Affection* (Nicholas Hytner) and Maya Deren never shared the same role in the film industry. The documents confirm that Maya Deren was a filmmaker, choreographer, and experimental filmmaker, while *The Object of My Affection* was directed by Nicholas Hytner. No documents mention any overlap in roles between them. The query must explicitly target their respective roles and ensure no shared positions are implied.  \n\n### query:  \n\"Nicholas Hytner role AND Maya Deren role\" OR \"director Nicholas Hytner AND Maya Deren film role\" OR \"Maya Deren film positions AND Nicholas Hytner film roles\""
