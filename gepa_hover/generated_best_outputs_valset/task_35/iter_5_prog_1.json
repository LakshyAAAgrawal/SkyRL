    "full_assistant_response": "### reasoning:  \nThe claim specifies Suh Jung as the lead in a 2000s South Korean film about an affair between a 32-year-old woman and a youth near legal majority, which premiered at Sundance. From the documents:  \n1. **Key Entities**: Suh Jung, \"Green Chair\" (2005), affair theme, 32-year-old woman, youth near legal majority.  \n2. **Specific Terms**: \"Green Chair\" (2005), Suh Jung\u2019s role in the film, the explicit affair description.  \n3. **Indirect Connections**: The Sundance premiere is explicitly mentioned in the claim but not in the documents. However, the query must include it to align with the claim.  \n4. **Avoid Overgeneralization**: Use exact terms like \"Green Chair (2005)\" and \"Suh Jung\" instead of vague terms.  \n5. **Test for Missing Context**: The Sundance premiere is a critical detail in the claim, so it is included despite its absence in the documents.  \n\n### query:  \n\"Suh Jung\" AND \"Green Chair (2005)\" AND \"affair between a thirty-two-year-old woman and a youth just short of legal majority\" AND \"Sundance Film Festival\""
