    "full_assistant_response": "### reasoning: The claim states that the Group containing the 43d Aeromedical Evacuation Squadron is stationed at Fort Bragg. The documents confirm that the 43d Aeromedical Evacuation Squadron is part of the 43d Air Mobility Operations Group, which is stationed at Pope Field, Fort Bragg, North Carolina. To capture this relationship, the query must include the Squadron, its parent Group, and the stationing location (Fort Bragg/Pope Field). Variations like \"Pope Army Air Field\" and \"Pope Field\" are included to ensure flexibility. The query explicitly links the Group to the location using precise terms like \"stationed at\" and \"located at\" to align with document phrasing.  \n### query: (\"43d Aeromedical Evacuation Squadron\" AND \"43d Air Mobility Operations Group\" AND (\"Fort Bragg\" OR \"Pope Field\" OR \"Pope Army Air Field\")) OR (\"43d Air Mobility Operations Group\" AND \"stationed at\" OR \"located at\" OR \"based at\" AND (\"Fort Bragg\" OR \"Pope Field\" OR \"Pope Army Air Field\"))"
