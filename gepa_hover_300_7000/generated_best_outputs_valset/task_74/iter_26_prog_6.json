    "full_assistant_response": "### reasoning:  \nThe claim asserts that **Sara Eskander Poulsen** achieved **mainstream success** on **The Suite Life of Zack & Cody** by voicing an animated character. However, the documents clarify that:  \n1. **Sara Poulsen** is best known for voicing **Candace Flynn** in **Phineas and Ferb** (animated) and **dubbing London Tipton** (Brenda Song\u2019s character) in **The Suite Life of Zack & Cody** (live-action).  \n2. **Mainstream success** on **The Suite Life of Zack & Cody** is explicitly attributed to **Ashley Tisdale** (as Maddie Fitzpatrick) in the documents, not Sara Poulsen.  \n3. The term \"animated character\" may ambiguously refer to either **Phineas and Ferb** (animated) or **The Suite Life** (live-action).  \n\nTo address gaps and ambiguities:  \n- Explicitly link Sara Poulsen to **dubbing London Tipton** in **The Suite Life of Zack & Cody**.  \n- Clarify that her **animated character work** refers to **Phineas and Ferb**.  \n- Note the **discrepancy** in mainstream success attribution (Ashley Tisdale vs. Sara Poulsen).  \n- Use synonyms like **\"dubbing\"** or **\"voice work\"** to capture her role in The Suite Life.  \n\n### query:  \n\"Sara Eskander Poulsen\" AND (\"dubbing London Tipton\" OR \"voice of London Tipton\") AND \"The Suite Life of Zack & Cody\" AND (\"Phineas and Ferb\" OR \"Candace Flynn\") AND NOT (\"mainstream success\" AND \"Ashley Tisdale\")"
