    "full_assistant_response": "### reasoning:  \nThe claim compares the area of Linzhou, Henan to the area where Liaoning Finance and Trade College is located. The documents explicitly state Linzhou\u2019s area (2046 km\u00b2) but do not directly mention the area of the college\u2019s location (Xingcheng, Liaoning). To support the claim, the query must retrieve documents containing Linzhou\u2019s area and any references to the college\u2019s location (e.g., Xingcheng) or its campus size. Since the documents lack the college\u2019s area, the query prioritizes terms like \"Linzhou area\" and \"Xingcheng\" to infer relative size.  \n\n### query:  \n\"Linzhou area\" AND (\"Xingcheng\" OR \"Liaoning Finance and Trade College\") AND (\"square kilometers\" OR \"area size\")"
