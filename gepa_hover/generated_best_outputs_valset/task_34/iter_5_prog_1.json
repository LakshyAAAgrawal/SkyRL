    "full_assistant_response": "### reasoning:  \nThe claim states that the American actress who performed \"Take On The World\" with Sabrina Carpenter was a star of *Invisible Sister*. From the documents, we identify:  \n1. **Key entities**: Sabrina Carpenter (actor/singer), \"Take On The World\" (song), *Invisible Sister* (movie), and its stars (Rowan Blanchard, Paris Berelc).  \n2. **Specific terms**: The exact song title (\"Take On The World\"), Sabrina Carpenter, and the movie *Invisible Sister* (with its stars).  \n3. **Indirect connections**: The claim links the actress to both the song and the movie. Since the documents do not mention \"Take On The World,\" we prioritize the explicit terms in the documents (e.g., *Invisible Sister* and its stars) to ensure relevance.  \n4. **Avoid overgeneralization**: Instead of vague terms like \"actress\" or \"song,\" we use precise terms like \"Take On The World\" and \"Invisible Sister\" (with its stars) to target documents directly.  \n\n### query:  \n\"Take On The World\" AND Sabrina Carpenter AND \"Invisible Sister\" AND (Rowan Blanchard OR Paris Berelc)"
