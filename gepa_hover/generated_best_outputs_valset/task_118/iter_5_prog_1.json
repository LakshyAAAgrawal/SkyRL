    "full_assistant_response": "### reasoning:  \nThe claim asserts that Scott Shepherd's filmography does not include Rudolf Abel. The documents list Scott Shepherd's films as \"Bridge of Spies,\" \"Side Effects,\" and \"Jason Bourne.\" Rudolf Abel is explicitly identified as a Soviet intelligence officer, not an actor. To support the claim, the query must confirm that none of Scott Shepherd's films feature Rudolf Abel. Since the documents do not mention Rudolf Abel in the context of these films, the query should focus on explicitly linking Scott Shepherd's films to Rudolf Abel to verify absence. Specific terms like exact film titles and Rudolf Abel's full name are prioritized to avoid ambiguity.  \n\n### query:  \n\"Scott Shepherd\" AND (\"Bridge of Spies\" OR \"Side Effects\" OR \"Jason Bourne\") AND \"Rudolf Abel\""
