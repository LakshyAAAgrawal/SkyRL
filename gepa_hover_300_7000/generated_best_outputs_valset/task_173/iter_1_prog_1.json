    "full_assistant_response": "### reasoning:  \nThe claim identifies Matt (likely Matt Kadane, as he is part of Overseas) and states his prior band was a rock band, while Hinder is also a rock band. Documents confirm Matt Kadane was in Bedhead and The New Year (rock bands) before joining Overseas and that Hinder is explicitly described as a rock band.
