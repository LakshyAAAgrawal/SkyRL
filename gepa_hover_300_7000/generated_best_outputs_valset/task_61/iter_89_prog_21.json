    "full_assistant_response": "### reasoning:  \nThe claim states that two individuals\u2014**the director of the 1943 film \"Young and Willing\"** and **Edward Burns**\u2014are **from Germany**. To retrieve supporting documents, the query must:  \n1. **Identify the director of \"Young and Willing\"** (from the documents, this is **Edward H. Griffith**).  \n2. **Include both individuals** (Edward H. Griffith and Edward Burns) and explicitly state their **nationality** (Germany).  \n3. **Account for synonyms or variations** (e.g., \"German\" OR \"from Germany,\" \"born in Germany\").  \n4. **Structure relationships** (e.g., \"director of,\" \"born in,\" \"associated with\").  \n5. **Ensure flexibility** by including exact names (e.g., \"Edward H. Griffith,\" \"Edward Burns\") and precise terms (e.g., \"1943 film,\" \"Germany\").  \n\n### query:  \n(\"Edward H. Griffith\" OR \"Edward H Griffith\") AND (\"Young and Willing\" OR \"Young and Willing (1943)\") AND (\"director\" OR \"directed\") AND (\"Germany\" OR \"German\" OR \"from Germany\" OR \"born in Germany\") AND (\"Edward Burns\" OR \"Edward Burns (actor)\" OR \"Edward Burns (director)\") AND (\"nationality\" OR \"origin\" OR \"born in\" OR \"from\")  \n\nThis query ensures all key entities (names, film, nationality) are included, with logical operators to capture synonyms, variations, and indirect relationships. It prioritizes exact terms (e.g., film title, director name) while allowing flexibility for potential contextual matches."
