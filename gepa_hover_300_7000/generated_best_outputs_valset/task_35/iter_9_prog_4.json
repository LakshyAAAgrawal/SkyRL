    "full_assistant_response": "### reasoning:  \nThe claim specifies Suh Jung as the lead in a 2000s South Korean film about an affair between a 32-year-old woman and a youth near legal majority, which premiered at Sundance. The documents confirm Suh Jung starred in *Green Chair* (2005) and describe its plot matching the affair details. However, no document explicitly links *Green Chair* to Sundance. To support the claim, the query must prioritize Suh Jung, the film's description, and the Sundance premiere. Since the documents do not mention Sundance for *Green Chair*, the query should focus on the film's attributes and the Sundance connection, using exact phrases and Boolean operators to narrow results.  \n\n### query:  \n\"Suh Jung Green Chair 2005 AND (affair between 32-year-old woman AND youth near legal majority) AND (Sundance premiere OR Sundance Film Festival)\""
