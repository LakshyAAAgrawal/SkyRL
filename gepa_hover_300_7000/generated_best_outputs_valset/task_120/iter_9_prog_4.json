    "full_assistant_response": "### reasoning:  \nThe claim identifies George Whitefield, John Wesley, and the Anglican priest (Edward Perronet\u2019s father) as founders of Methodism in the 18th-century Church of England. The documents confirm that Edward Perronet\u2019s father was an Anglican priest who collaborated with John Wesley and Charles Wesley, while Methodism originated as a revival within the Church of England. To align with the documents, the query must explicitly link George Whitefield, John Wesley, and the Anglican priest (via Edward Perronet) to the Methodist movement\u2019s 18th-century origins in the Church of England.  \n\n### query:  \n\"George Whitefield John Wesley Edward Perronet's father Anglican priest Methodist movement 18th century Church of England revival\" OR \"Methodism founded by George Whitefield John Wesley Anglican priest Edward Perronet 18th century Church of England\" OR \"Edward Perronet father Anglican priest John Wesley George Whitefield Methodist movement Church of England 1700s\""
