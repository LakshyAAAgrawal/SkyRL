    "full_assistant_response": "### reasoning:  \nThe claim states that Dawn Roma French and Jennifer Saunders co-starred in both \"French and Saunders\" (a sketch show) and a movie that also featured Al Pillay. The documents confirm that Dawn French and Jennifer Saunders starred in \"French and Saunders\" (document 2) and in \"The Supergrass\" film (document 7). However, **no document mentions Al Pillay**, so the query must focus on the shared work between Dawn French and Jennifer Saunders while explicitly including \"Al Pillay\" to address the claim\u2019s second part. Since the documents lack direct evidence of Al Pillay\u2019s involvement, the query prioritizes the verified co-starring roles and the movie title.  \n\n### query:  \n\"Dawn French Jennifer Saunders movie Al Pillay\" OR \"French and Saunders movie with Al Pillay\" OR \"The Supergrass Al Pillay\""
