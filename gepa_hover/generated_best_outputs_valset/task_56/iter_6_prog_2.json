    "full_assistant_response": "### reasoning:  \nThe claim specifies that the author of *Detective* (novel) has three best sellers released before Donna Tartt\u2019s birth in 1980: *Hotel* (1965), *Airport* (1968), and *Wheels* (1971). From the documents, **Arthur Hailey** is explicitly linked to these three books as best sellers. However, the documents do not mention a novel titled *Detective* by Hailey. To align with the claim, the query must explicitly tie the author of *Detective* to these works while ensuring the release dates precede Donna Tartt\u2019s birth year (1980). Since the documents confirm Donna Tartt was born in 1963, the claim\u2019s 1980 birth year appears incorrect, but the query must follow the claim\u2019s stated data.  \n\n### query:  \n\"Author of *Detective* (novel) whose three best sellers released before Donna Tartt\u2019s birth in 1980 are *Hotel* (1965), *Airport* (1968), and *Wheels* (1971), including the author\u2019s name, publication years, and connection to the novel *Detective*.\""
