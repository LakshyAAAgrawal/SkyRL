    "full_assistant_response": "### reasoning:  \nThe claim states that the album containing \"Right Now (Psy song)\" is Psy's debut album for the entertainment company established by Lee Jung-hyun. Documents confirm that \"Right Now\" is from PsyFive (the fifth album, not the debut), and Psy's debut album is \"Psy from the Psycho World!\" (2001). However, the claim incorrectly attributes the debut album to Lee Jung-hyun's company. The query must address the claim's components: \"Right Now (Psy song)\", \"debut album\", and the connection to Lee Jung-hyun's company. Since the documents do not explicitly link Lee Jung-hyun to the company, the query focuses on the song and the company's name (e.g., YG Entertainment, mentioned in PsyFive's context).  \n\n### query:  \n\"Right Now (Psy song)\" AND \"debut album\" AND \"Lee Jung-hyun company\" OR \"YG Entertainment\""
