    "full_assistant_response": "### reasoning:  \nThe claim states that \"Licence Revoked\" was the original title of a film featuring an actor from *Maniac Cop 2*, who plays the villain Franz Sanchez. The documents confirm that \"Licence to Kill\" (originally titled \"Licence Revoked\") features Robert Davi as Franz Sanchez. However, the actor from *Maniac Cop 2* (Robert Z'Dar) is not explicitly linked to \"Licence Revoked\" in the documents. To address the claim, the query must focus on the original title, the actor from *Maniac Cop 2*, and the role of Franz Sanchez. Since the documents do not directly connect the two, the query prioritizes the film's original title and the actor's role to find supporting evidence.  \n\n### query:  \n\"License Revoked original title\" AND \"actor from Maniac Cop 2\" AND \"Franz Sanchez\""
