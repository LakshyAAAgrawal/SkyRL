    "full_assistant_response": "### reasoning:  \nThe claim asserts that the Walt Disney film featuring the song \"I've Got No Strings\" (not *Home on the Range*) was Disney's 2nd animated production.  \n\n1. **Analyze the Claim**:  \n   - **Entities**: \"I've Got No Strings\" (song), *Pinocchio* (film), \"Home on the Range\" (film).  \n   - **Attributes**: The film is Disney's 2nd animated production.  \n   - **Relationships**: The song is featured in the film, not in *Home on the Range*.  \n\n2. **Cross-Reference with Documents**:  \n   - Document 1 explicitly links \"I've Got No Strings\" to *Pinocchio* (1940), confirming the song's presence.  \n   - Document 2 lists Disney's animated shorts from 1921, but does not specify the order of feature films.  \n   - Document 5 mentions \"Walt Disney Classics\" and the transition from the Classics line to the Masterpiece Collection, but does not detail production order.  \n   - Documents 3\u20134 and 7 refer to later films (*Home on the Range*, *Lilo & Stitch*), which are not relevant to the claim.  \n\n3. **Identify Key Search Terms**:  \n   - \"I've Got No Strings\" (song), *Pinocchio* (film), \"Disney's 2nd animated production,\" and \"Home on the Range\" (to exclude).  \n\n4. **Address Ambiguity or Missing Entities**:  \n   - The claim assumes *Pinocchio* is Disney's 2nd animated production, but the documents do not explicitly state this. However, *Pinocchio* is widely recognized as Disney's 2nd feature (after *Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs* in 1937), though this is not confirmed in the provided texts.  \n\n5. **Structure the Query**:  \n   - Focus on confirming the song's association with *Pinocchio* and its position as the 2nd animated production.  \n\n6. **Include Domain-Specific Context**:  \n   - Reference Disney's production timeline (e.g., \"1940,\" \"feature films,\" \"animated production\").  \n\n7. **Avoid Overgeneralization**:  \n   - Specify the song, film, and production order to avoid ambiguity.  \n\n### query:  \n\"Disney animated film featuring 'I\\'ve Got No Strings' (1940) AND (2nd animated production OR position in Disney\\'s filmography) AND NOT 'Home on the Range'\""
