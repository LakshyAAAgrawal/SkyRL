    "full_assistant_response": "### reasoning:  \nThe claim identifies the **43d Aeromedical Evacuation Squadron** as part of a **Group** stationed at **Fort Bragg**. Key components include:  \n1. **Explicit terms**: \"43d Aeromedical Evacuation Squadron,\" \"Fort Bragg,\" \"Group.\"  \n2. **Implicit terms**: \"43d Air Mobility Operations Group\" (parent group of the squadron), \"Pope Field\" (a component of Fort Bragg).  \n3. **Domain-specific knowledge**: \"Air Mobility Command\" (context for the group\u2019s hierarchy), \"Pope Army Air Field\" (specific location within Fort Bragg).  \n4. **Ambiguity resolution**: \"Fort Bragg\" is prioritized to avoid confusion with other bases, while \"Pope Field\" and \"Pope Army Air Field\" are included to capture the exact stationing details.  \n\nThe query combines explicit terms (squadron name, Fort Bragg) with implicit terms (group name, Pope Field) using logical operators to ensure specificity and coverage.  \n\n### query:  \n\"43d Aeromedical Evacuation Squadron\" AND (\"43d Air Mobility Operations Group\" OR \"43d Air Mobility Operations Group\") AND (\"Fort Bragg\" OR \"Pope Field\" OR \"Pope Army Air Field\") AND (\"stationed at\" OR \"located at\" OR \"based at\")  \n\n**Note**: The query explicitly links the squadron to its parent group and location, ensuring documents like the first two examples are retrieved. The inclusion of \"Pope Field\" and \"Pope Army Air Field\" accounts for indirect references to Fort Bragg."
