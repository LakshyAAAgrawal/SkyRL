    "full_assistant_response": "### reasoning:  \nThe claim specifies that a company headquartered at **Port Plaza Mall** was ranked **81st by Forbes in 2016**. The key entities are **Port Plaza Mall** (location), the company (not explicitly named in the claim), and the **Forbes ranking**. The documents reveal that **Schreiber Foods** is headquartered in **Green Bay, Wisconsin**, where **Port Plaza Mall** was located. Additionally, **Schreiber Foods** is explicitly ranked **81st** by **Forbes** in **2016** as the largest private employer. The query must capture:  \n1. **Port Plaza Mall** (exact name) and its **location** (Green Bay, Wisconsin).  \n2. **Schreiber Foods** (company name) and its **headquarters** (Green Bay, Wisconsin).  \n3. **Forbes ranking** (number 81) and **year 2016**.  \n4. Indirect connections (e.g., \"headquartered in Green Bay\" or \"Forbes ranked... 81st\").  \n\n### query:  \n(\"Port Plaza Mall\" AND \"Green Bay, Wisconsin\") OR (\"Schreiber Foods\" AND \"headquartered\" AND \"Green Bay, Wisconsin\") AND (\"Forbes\" AND \"ranked\" AND \"81\" AND \"2016\")  \nOR (\"Forbes\" AND \"ranked 81st\" AND \"2016\" AND \"headquartered at Port Plaza Mall\")  \nOR (\"Forbes\" AND \"ranked 81\" AND \"2016\" AND \"Schreiber Foods\")  \nOR (\"Forbes\" AND \"ranked 81st\" AND \"2016\" AND \"headquartered in Green Bay\")"
