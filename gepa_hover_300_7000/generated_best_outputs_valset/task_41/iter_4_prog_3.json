    "full_assistant_response": "### reasoning: The claim states that the Seton Hall Pirates and another team play at the same venue as *Extreme Rules (2016)*. The documents only mention the Seton Hall Pirates' home games at the Prudential Center in Newark, New Jersey, but do not reference *Extreme Rules (2016)* or its location. To support the claim, the query must explicitly include all entities (Seton Hall Pirates, *Extreme Rules (2016)*, and the implied venue) and relationships (e.g., \"played at the same place as\"). Since the documents lack direct evidence of *Extreme Rules (2016)*, the query must still capture the required entities and relationships to identify potential matches. \n\n### query: \"Seton Hall Pirates AND (Extreme Rules 2016) AND (Prudential Center OR Newark New Jersey) AND (another team)\""
