    "full_assistant_response": "### reasoning:  \nThe claim identifies the owner of Tatoosh (a yacht) as an American business magnate, investor, and philanthropist with a sister named Jo Lynn \"Jody\". The documents explicitly mention **Jody Allen** as **Paul Allen's sister**, and Paul Allen is described as a co-founder of Microsoft, an American business magnate, investor, and philanthropist. While the documents do not directly mention \"Tatoosh,\" they confirm the connection between Jody Allen and Paul Allen, aligning with the claim\u2019s attributes. The query must link **Jody Allen** to **Paul Allen** and validate his status as a business magnate, investor, and philanthropist.  \n\n### query:  \n\"Jody Allen Paul Allen sister\" AND \"Paul Allen American business magnate investor philanthropist\" AND \"Tatoosh owner\""
