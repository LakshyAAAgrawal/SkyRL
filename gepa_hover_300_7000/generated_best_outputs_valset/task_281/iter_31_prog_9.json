    "full_assistant_response": "### reasoning:  \nThe claim identifies a mentor from the **3rd Sa Re Ga Ma Pa Challenge** (2009) who was also a judge on **STAR Voice of India** and died in **Kokilaben hospital**. To capture this, the query must:  \n1. **List all mentors** explicitly named in the 3rd Sa Re Ga Ma Pa Challenge (2009): **Aadesh Shrivastava, Shankar Mahadevan, Pritam, Himesh Reshammiya**.  \n2. **Include STAR Voice of India** and its synonyms (e.g., \"STAR Voice India\") to capture the judge role.  \n3. **Explicitly mention Kokilaben hospital** and its variations (e.g., \"Kokilaben Hospital\") to address the death location.  \n4. **Use logical operators (AND/OR)** to ensure flexibility while retaining specificity (e.g., \"died in\" OR \"passed away at\").  \n5. **Avoid ambiguity** by prioritizing exact names and roles (e.g., \"judge on STAR Voice of India\" instead of general terms like \"television judge\").  \n\n### query:  \n`(Aadesh Shrivastava OR Shankar Mahadevan OR Pritam OR Himesh Reshammiya) AND (STAR Voice of India OR STAR Voice India) AND (Kokilaben hospital OR Kokilaben Hospital OR died in Kokilaben hospital OR passed away at Kokilaben hospital)`"
