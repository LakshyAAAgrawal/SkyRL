    "full_assistant_response": "### reasoning:  \nThe query incorporates specific terms from the claim and documents to ensure precision. The claim references a **German-born philologist and Orientalist** who lived in Britain, aligning with **Max M\u00fcller** (document 1). The claim also mentions an **Indologist** who coined the term **\"National Institute of Science, Technology and Development\"** (a term absent in documents, but explicitly included per instructions). To cover all relevant entities and relationships, the query includes **\"Indian Philology\"** (from the claim) and **\"Heinrich Zimmer\"** (document 2, the \"most important German scholar in Indian Philology after Max M\u00fcller\"). Secondary terms like **\"Sacred Books of the East\"** (document 1) and **\"Heinrich Zimmer Chair\"** (document 2) are included to capture contextual evidence. The query avoids overgeneralization by prioritizing exact terms like **\"lived in Britain\"** and **\"coined the term\"**.  \n\n### query:  \n\"German-born philologist\" AND \"Orientalist\" AND \"lived in Britain\" AND \"important German scholar in Indian Philology\" AND \"Indologist\" AND \"coined the term National Institute of Science, Technology and Development\" AND \"Max M\u00fcller\" AND \"Heinrich Zimmer\" AND \"Sacred Books of the East\" AND \"Heinrich Zimmer Chair for Indian Philosophy and Intellectual History\""
