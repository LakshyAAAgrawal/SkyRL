    "full_assistant_response": "### reasoning:  \nThe claim specifies that Crosstown Plaza in Schenectady, NY is near a major interstate (I-890, as explicitly stated in the documents) and that this interstate (I-890) and I-90 are highways running through Schenectady. Key entities include **Crosstown Plaza**, **I-890**, **I-90**, and **Schenectady, NY**. The documents directly link Crosstown Plaza to **I-890** via NY State Route 7 and describe **I-890** as a major highway connecting to **I-90** (the Thruway). Specific terms like \"I-890 entrance,\" \"Schenectady,\" and \"Thruway\" are critical to avoid overgeneralization and ensure precise retrieval.  \n\n### query:  \n\"Crosstown Plaza Schenectady NY\" AND \"I-890\" AND \"I-90\" AND (\"Thruway\" OR \"New York State Thruway\") AND (\"interstate\" OR \"highway\") AND (\"Schenectady\" OR \"Capital District\")"
