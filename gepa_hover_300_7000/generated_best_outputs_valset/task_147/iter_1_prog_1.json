    "full_assistant_response": "### reasoning:  \nThe claim asserts that M. P. Shiel and the British author of *The Ingo tetralogy* (Helen Dunmore) are **not both of German descent**. The documents confirm that Helen Dunmore is an English writer, explicitly stating she is \"British\" and \"English writer,\" which directly contradicts German descent. Since the claim hinges on the assertion that **at least one** is not of German descent, and the documents confirm Dunmore is British, the query must focus on verifying Dunmore\u2019s nationality and checking Shiel\u2019s descent. However, since the documents do not mention Shiel, the query prioritizes confirming Dunmore\u2019s nationality to support the claim.  \n\n### query:  \n\"Helen Dunmore nationality\" AND \"M. P. Shiel descent\""
