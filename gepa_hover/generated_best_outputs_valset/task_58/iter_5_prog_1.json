From the documents:  \n1. **Fahizah** is explicitly tied to **Pinhead Gunpowder** (document 6).  \n2. **Billie Joe Armstrong** is a member of **Pinhead Gunpowder** (document 5).  \n3. The shared connection is that **Billie Joe Armstrong** is part of the band that released **Fahizah**.  \nTo ensure precision, the query must explicitly name **Pinhead Gunpowder** (the band linked to Fahizah) and **Billie Joe Armstrong** (the individual). Avoid vague terms like \"band\" or \"musician.\"  \n\n### query:  \n\"Pinhead Gunpowder\" AND \"Billie Joe Armstrong\""
