    "full_assistant_response": "### reasoning:  \nThe claim links Dale Reid's role as Europe's non-playing captain to a competition hosted by a golf club using Rossdhu Mansion as its clubhouse. The documents confirm Dale Reid was Europe's non-playing captain in 2000 and 2002 (Document 3) and that Loch Lomond Golf Club uses Rossdhu Mansion as its clubhouse (Document 1). To connect these, the query must explicitly tie Dale Reid\u2019s captaincy to the club with Rossdhu Mansion. Using exact terms like \"non-playing captain,\" \"Rossdhu Mansion,\" and \"Loch Lomond Golf Club\" ensures relevance.  \n\n### query:  \n\"Dale Reid non-playing captain Rossdhu Mansion\" OR \"Loch Lomond Golf Club Rossdhu Mansion\" AND \"Europe captain\""
