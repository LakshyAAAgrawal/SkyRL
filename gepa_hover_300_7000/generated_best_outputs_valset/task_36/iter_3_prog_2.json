    "full_assistant_response": "### reasoning:  \nThe claim states that David William Oxtoby was the ninth president of an educational institution and that Brown University was founded before this institution. From the documents:  \n1. **David William Oxtoby** is explicitly identified as the **ninth president of Pomona College**, serving from 2003\u20132017.  \n2. **Brown University** is confirmed to have been founded in **1764**.  \n3. The claim hinges on verifying that **Pomona College was established after 1764** (Brown\u2019s founding year). However, the documents do not explicitly mention Pomona College\u2019s founding date. This creates a gap: the claim assumes Pomona College was founded after Brown, but the documents lack direct confirmation.  \n\nTo resolve this, the query must retrieve Pomona College\u2019s founding date to validate the timeline. Since the documents do not provide this detail, the query must explicitly target the founding date of Pomona College and compare it with Brown University\u2019s known founding year (1764).  \n\n### query:  \n\"Pomona College founding date\" AND \"Brown University founded before Pomona College\" AND \"David William Oxtoby ninth president Pomona College\""
