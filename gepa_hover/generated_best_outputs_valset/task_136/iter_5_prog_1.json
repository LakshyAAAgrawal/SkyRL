    "full_assistant_response": "### reasoning:  \nThe claim asserts two key points: (1) the Can de Palleiro originated in **Wong**, and (2) it was **not** the dog bred with the Old English Bulldog to create the Boxer. The documents confirm the Can de Palleiro originated in **Galicia (Spain)**, not Wong, and clarify that the Boxer was bred from the **Old English Bulldog** and **Bullenbeisser**, not the Can de Palleiro. To support the claim, the query must:  \n1. Verify the origin of the Can de Palleiro (specifically \"Wong\" vs. \"Galicia\").  \n2. Confirm the Boxer\u2019s lineage (Old English Bulldog + Bullenbeisser) and exclude the Can de Palleiro.  \n3. Use precise terms like \"Can de Palleiro,\" \"Wong,\" \"Old English Bulldog,\" \"Boxer,\" and \"Bullenbeisser\" to avoid ambiguity.  \n\n### query:  \n\"Can de Palleiro\" AND \"origin\" AND \"Wong\" OR \"Boxer\" AND \"Old English Bulldog\" AND \"Bullenbeisser\" AND NOT \"Can de Palleiro\""
