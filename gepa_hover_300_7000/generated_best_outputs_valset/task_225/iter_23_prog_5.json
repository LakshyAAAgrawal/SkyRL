    "full_assistant_response": "### reasoning:  \nThe claim states that Southwest Airlines Flight 2294 landed at an airport in the same country as Albert J. Ellis Airport. From the documents, Southwest Airlines Flight 2294 landed at **Yeager Airport (CRW)** in **Charleston, West Virginia, USA**. To verify the country of Albert J. Ellis Airport, the query must explicitly include both airports and their locations. Since the documents do not mention Albert J. Ellis Airport, the query must prioritize the known details (Yeager Airport in the USA) and explicitly include the entity \"Albert J. Ellis Airport\" to ensure alignment with the claim. Logical operators (AND/OR) are used to capture relationships and synonyms, but since Albert J. Ellis Airport is unverified, the query focuses on the known components.  \n\n### query:  \n\"Southwest Airlines Flight 2294\" AND (\"Yeager Airport\" OR \"Charleston, West Virginia\" OR \"United States\") AND (\"Albert J. Ellis Airport\" OR \"same country\" OR \"same nation\") AND (location OR country)  \n**Note**: The documents do not mention \"Albert J. Ellis Airport,\" so the query may return no results. However, it is structured to explicitly capture the claim's components as per the guidelines."
