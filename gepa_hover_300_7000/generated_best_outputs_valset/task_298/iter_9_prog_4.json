    "full_assistant_response": "### reasoning:  \nThe claim references a genus with a species named \"radians\" found in Northern Cape, South Africa, and asserts it has more species than *Stenocarpus*. From the documents, **Geissorhiza radians** is explicitly linked to Northern Cape. However, the documents do not mention *Stenocarpus* or compare species counts. To support the claim, the query must:  \n1. Focus on **Geissorhiza radians** and its geographic location.  \n2. Include terms to infer species count (e.g., \"number of species,\" \"species count\").  \n3. Explicitly mention *Stenocarpus* to align with the claim\u2019s comparison.  \n\n### query:  \n\"Geissorhiza radians Northern Cape\" AND (\"number of species\" OR \"species count\") AND \"Stenocarpus\"  \nOR  \n\"Geissorhiza radians\" AND \"species count\" AND \"more than Stenocarpus\""
