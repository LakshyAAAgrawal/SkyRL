    "full_assistant_response": "### reasoning:  \nThe claim links the \"Andamanese language of an uncontacted people\" to a specific Andaman Island in the Bay of Bengal. From the documents, the **Sentinelese** are explicitly described as an uncontacted people on **North Sentinel Island** (part of the Andaman Islands) whose language is unclassifiable. The **Andaman Islands** are directly tied to the **Bay of Bengal** in the documents. While the Sentinelese language is unclassified, the claim assumes it is part of the broader \"Andamanese languages.\" To support this, the query must explicitly target the **Sentinelese**, their **uncontacted status**, their **language**, and their **location** (Andaman Islands/Bay of Bengal).  \n\n### query:  \n\"Sentinelese AND uncontacted AND language AND Andaman Islands\""
