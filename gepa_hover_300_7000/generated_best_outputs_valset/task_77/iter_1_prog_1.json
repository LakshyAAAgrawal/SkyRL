    "full_assistant_response": "### reasoning:  \nThe claim identifies \"Perfect\" as the final commercial single from *Adore* and notes two promotional singles (likely \"Crestfallen\" and \"To Sheila\") with one featuring artwork by a Ukrainian photographer. The documents confirm \"Crestfallen\" was a promotional single and explicitly states its artwork is by Yelena Yemchuk. Since Yelena Yemchuk is a Ukrainian photographer, this directly supports the claim. The query must target the Smashing Pumpkins, *Adore*, promotional singles, and the Ukrainian photographer.  \n\n### query:  \n\"Smashing Pumpkins Adore promotional singles\" AND \"Ukrainian photographer\" AND \"artwork\""
