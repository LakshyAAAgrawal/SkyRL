    "full_assistant_response": "### reasoning:  \nThe claim specifies that the British monarch (Elizabeth II) is the head of state for the territory where **Keightley Way** connects **Plaza Kotaraya at Little Bay** to the **Muslim place of worship** (Ibrahim-al-Ibrahim Mosque) and **Nun's Well at Europa Point**. The documents clarify that **Keightley Way** and these locations are in **Gibraltar**, a **British Overseas Territory**. Since the British Overseas Territories share Elizabeth II as head of state, the query must explicitly include **Gibraltar**, **Keightley Way**, **Ibrahim-al-Ibrahim Mosque**, **Nun's Well**, and **Queen Elizabeth II** to ensure specificity. Vague terms like \"British monarch\" are avoided in favor of precise references to the territory and entities.  \n\n### query:  \n\"Keightley Way\" AND \"Ibrahim-al-Ibrahim Mosque\" AND \"Nun's Well\" AND \"Gibraltar\" AND \"Queen Elizabeth II\""
