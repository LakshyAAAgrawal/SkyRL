    "full_assistant_response": "### reasoning: The claim specifies three key points: (1) Orontioideae is a subfamily of Araceae, (2) skunk cabbage species (Lysichiton/Symplocarpus) in North America/Asia belong to Orontioideae, and (3) Orontioideae and Ageratum are not in the same family. The first document explicitly confirms Orontioideae\u2019s classification in Araceae and lists Lysichiton/Symplocarpus as skunk cabbage genera. The third part requires checking if Ageratum is in a different family (e.g., Asteraceae), though the documents do not mention Ageratum. To ensure all entities and relationships are included, the query must explicitly reference Orontioideae, Araceae, skunk cabbage, Lysichiton/Symplocarpus, North America/Asia, and Ageratum. Synonyms (e.g., \"skunk cabbage\" vs. \"Lysichiton\") and relationships (e.g., \"not in the same family\") are critical for coverage.\n\n### query: \"Orontioideae subfamily of Araceae AND (skunk cabbage species in North America and Asia) AND (Ageratum genus not in same family as Orontioideae) AND (Lysichiton OR Symplocarpus)\""
